This is the development version of AMRVAC.  


Get started by running a problem from the tests folder.  
E.g. the tests/mhd/orszag-tang is checked to work with the newest code-version.  Traditionally, you should run tests/rho/vac as your first test :-).  
A quick start is found in doc/GettingStarted.html and changes from the old svn version are summarized in doc/gitversion.html
