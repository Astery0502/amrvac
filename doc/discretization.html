<H2><A NAME="Equation">Equation</A></H2>

MPI-AMRVAC aims to solve a system of partial differential equations of the form  
<pre>
dw/dt=-dF_i(w)/dx_i+S(w)=R(w)
</pre>
where w is a vector of <b>iw=1..nw</b> flow variables, <b>F_i</b> are fluxes in
<b>idim=1..ndim</b> directions for each <b>w</b>, and <b>S</b> is the 
source including all terms which are not described by <b>F_i</b>. 
The flux and source terms together are denoted by <b>R</b>.
(The name of the equation is also known by a character string parameter 
<b>typephys</b> in <b>src/EQUATION/amrvacpar.t</b>). The discretization is of a finite volume kind, where cell-centered quantities represent cell-averaged densities for conservative variables.

<H2><A NAME="Splitting">Dimensional</A> and Source Splitting</H2>

Some methods were originally designed to handle 1D problems, they may be
best applied to multidimensional problems by splitting the equation for
the derivatives of the flux, and solving the split equations in subsequent 
sweeps. All these strategies are handled in the <em>advance.t</em> module.
<p>
For a forward Euler time integration scheme the above equation can be 
discretised in time as
<pre>
 n+1                        n
w    = [I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S)] w
</pre>
where Fx, Fy, and Fz are short notations for the dF_i/dx_i terms for 3D.
<p>
Dimensional splitting means the following approximations:
<pre>
I+dt*(Fx+Fy+S)    --> [I+dt*(Fx+S/2)] [I+dt*(Fy+S/2)]                   (2D)

I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S) --> [I+dt*(Fx+S/3)] [I+dt*(Fy+S/3)] [I+dt*(Fz+S/3)]   (3D)
</pre>
<p>
In case <b>dimsplit=T</b>, the default splitting strategy is according to
<b>typedimsplit='xyyx'</b>, which ensures alternation in the order of the sweeps 
in every second time step. This alternation can be switched off by 
<b>typedimsplit='xy'</b> which may be useful for steady state calculations.
Depending on the selected scheme, we can also invoke no dimensional splitting at all, hence <b>dimsplit=F</b> (which implies <b>typedimsplit='unsplit'</b>).
<p>
The source terms S may also be separated from the fluxes F.
A reason to use split source terms may arise,
when the sources are stiff, or unstable for an explicit evaluation.
For steady state evolutions, one would typically use unsplit sources and no dimensional splitting at all.
Splitting sources from fluxes is achieved by <b>sourcesplit=T</b>. How sources are then added depends on <b>typesourcesplit</b>, which can be any of 4 pre-implemented combinations.
<p>
Setting <b>typesourcesplit='sfs'</b> results in
<pre>
I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S) --> [I+dt/2*S] [I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz)] [I+dt/2*S]
</pre>
for the dimensionally unsplit case, and
<pre>
I+dt*(Fx+Fy+S)    --> [I+dt/2*S] [I+dt*Fx] [I+dt*Fy] [I+dt/2*S]            (2D)

I+dt*(Fx+Fy+Fz+S) --> [I+dt/2*S] [I+dt*Fx] [I+dt*Fy] [I+dt*Fz] [I+dt/2*S]  (3D)
</pre>
for the dimensionally split case. To achieve second order time accuracy,
the numerical representation of the source term <b>S</b> should be second 
order accurate in time. In case of special source terms written by the user, 
this may be achieved by implementing e.g. a trapezoidal scheme in the 
<b>specialsource</b> subroutine. 
<p>
However a simple second order Runge-Kutta evaluation is already built in. 
Setting <b>typesourcesplit='ssfss'</b> gives the following evaluation for 
<b>w_S = [I+dt/2*S] w</b>:
<pre>
w_1 = w + dt/4 S(w)
w_S = w + dt/2 S(w_1)
</pre>
both at the beginning and at the end of the time step, otherwise the
default <b>w_S = w + dt/2 S(w)</b> is used. Other choices for 
<b>typesourcesplit</b> are <b>'sf', 'ssf'</b>. Note that the default is
<b>sourcesplit=F</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Methods">Time</A> Discretization</H2>

The code can use a variety of <A HREF="methods.html">methods</A> for spatial 
discretization of fluxes. A method is applied to all variables on a specific AMR level, but the method may differ from grid level to grid level.
As we saw in the previous section, the contribution of the fluxes 
(dimensionally split or unsplit, with or without the source terms) 
need to be evaluated to at least 2nd order accuracy in time.
Let <b>R</b> denote the general operator that represents any of the
Fx, (Fz+S/3), (Fx+Fy), (Fx+Fy+Fz+S), etc. terms that arise in the 
equations above depending on the number of dimensions and on the dimensional 
and source splitting parameters.
<p>
There are many options to evaluate <b>w_R=[I+dt*R] w</b>,
it is determined by the value of the <b>typeadvance</b> parameter
with the following options:
<pre>
w_R = w + dt*R(w)                     'onestep'

w_1 = w + dt/2*R'(w)                  'twostep'  (predictor step)
w_R = w + dt  *R (w_1)                           (corrector step)

w_1 = w + dt/2*R(w)	              'fourstep' (classical RK4)
w_2 = w + dt/2*R(w_1)
w_3 = w + dt  *R(w_2)
w_4 = w + dt/6*R(w_3)
w   = w + dt/6*[R(w_1)+2*R(w_2)+2*R(w_3)+R(w_4)]
</pre>
RK4 is fourth order accurate. Not all schemes can be combined with all options, infact
the TVD scheme should use <b>typeadvance='onestep'</b>, 
while the other temporally second order methods TVDLF, TVD-MUSCL, HLL, HLLC can
use <b>typeadvance='twostep'</b> or <b>typeadvance='fourstep'</b>.
<p>
Since in the twostep method the <b>R'</b> spatial discretization in the 
first <em>predictor</em> step can be different from <b>R</b> of the second
<em>corrector</em> step, the twostep time integration is a predictor-corrector 
type scheme. In the parameter file, the arrays <b>typepred1</b> and 
<b>typefull1</b> (which need to be specified for each AMR grid level up to <b>nlevelshi</b>), determine the method applied in the predictor and full step.
<p>
For the multistep RK4 integration scheme, the same <b>typefull1</b> 
method is used in each substep for <b>istep=1..nstep</b>.
Full timesteps are counted by <b>itmin &lt;= it &lt;= itmax</b>, while the
physical time is <b>t &lt;= tmax</b>.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="Grid">Grid</A> and Mesh</H2>

The grid is a 1, 2 or 3D grid, either Cartesian, cylindrical (to which polar belongs), or spherical.
The coordinates of the grid points are 
represented by the array <b>x</b>, usually interpreted as Cartesian
coordinates X, Y, and Z, except for cylindrical or polar grid, when they contain R, PHI,
and Z instead (the order for PHI and Z can be selected through the <b>setamrvac -z= -phi=</b> flags), and in spherical they always contain r, theta, phi (in that order).
Other useful cell-related quantities calculated from <b>x</b>, like distance
between cell interfaces, volume, surface, and surface normal, are also computed, and this happens in the <em>geometry.t</em> module, specifically in the <em>fillgeo</em> subroutine.
They are stored in the structures <em>pgeo(igrid)%surfaceC^D</em>, <em>pgeo(igrid)%surface^D</em>, <em>pgeo(igrid)%dvolume</em> and <em>pgeo(igrid)%dx</em>.
<p>
The spatial indices of these arrays, denoted by the dimension independent
<A HREF="source.html">syntax</A>, have varying ranges, depending on their use (as cell centered, or cell surface quantities).
Remember that the <em>setamrvac -g=</em> sets the grid plus ghost cell extent, whose width is set by <em>dixB</em>. This defines the total grid extent 
<pre>
ixGlo^D:ixGhi^D = ixG^T
</pre>
In many places, the same range, including ghost cells describing the boundaries, is denoted as
<pre>
ixGmin^D:ixGmax^D = ixG^S
</pre>
The mesh is defined as the grid without boundary layers:
<pre>
ixMmin^D,ixMmax^D = ixGmin^D+dixB,ixGmax^D-dixB
</pre>
or in a shorter notation
<pre>
ixM^L = ixG^L^LSUBdixB^L
</pre>
The ghost cells are updated by the subroutine <b>getbc</b>. When a file
is read or saved by MPI-AMRVAC, the ghost cells are not included.
<p>
You may run the <A HREF="vacpp.html">VACPP</A> preprocessor interactively 
to see how the above expressions are translated for a given number of 
dimensions.

<H2><A NAME="Boundary">Boundary</A> Regions</H2>

The boundary cells of the grid are grouped into boundary regions indexed by
<b>iB=1..nB</b>. In 1D, there are 2 regions, at left and right of the mesh; in 2D there are 4, left, right, bottom, top (in that order); while for 3D there are 6.
These boundary regions cover the <b>2*ndim</b> edges of the grid 
in the <em>left, right, bottom, top, front, back</em>, in other words, 
<em>ixmin1, ixmax1, ixmin2, ixmax2, ixmin3, ixmax3</em>, order. 
The regions overlap at the corner ghost cells.
<p>
The boundary methods are applied to each boundary region from <b>iB=1</b> 
to <b>nB</b> and for each variable from <b>iw=1</b> to <b>nw</b> according 
to the descriptor string <b>typeB(iw,iB)</b>. An exception is made for 
the <b>special</b> type variables, they are called <em>after</em> the other
variables have been extrapolated into the boundary region. 
<p>
Please note that the boundary itself is at the interface between the real and
ghost cells, therefore setting the velocity to 0 in the ghost cell will not
make the velocity 0 at the cell interface which is an interpolated value.
To have exactly zero flux through the boundary, the <b>'symm'</b> boundary 
type should be used for the scalar quantities and the tangential velocity
components. For the normal vector components the  anti-symmetric <b>'asymm'</b>
boundary type should be used.

<H3>Internal boundaries</H3>

Internal boundaries can be used to overwrite the domain variables with
specified values.  Internally, these are assigned before the
ghost-cells and external boundaries are applied (in subroutine 
<em>get_bc</em>).  The user can provide conditions on the conserved
variables depending on location or time in the subroutine
<em>bc_int</em> which is defaulted in
<em>amrvacnul.specialbound.t</em>.  To activate internal boundaries,
the switch
<pre>
internalboundary=.true.
</pre>
has to be set in the <em>boundlist</em> section of the par file.
