<h1>VAC PREPROCESSOR, as used for MPI-AMRVAC</h1>

This document briefly describes the use of the VAC PreProcessor (VACPP)
which converts dimension independent notation into Fortran 90.
VACPP is a specialized implementation of the general 
<A HREF="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gtoth/Papers/lasy.html"
>LASY Preprocessor</A>.
<hr>
   VACPP is implemented in Perl in the <b>src/vacpp.pl</b> script. 
   The main variables of VACPP, such as the number of dimensions 
   <b>$ndim</b> and vector components <b>$ndir</b>, are normally modified 
   by another Perl script <b>src/setamrvac</b>. Based on these variables 
   and the LASY patterns in the <b>*.t</b> source files VACPP generates the 
   Fortran 90 source code of the output <b>*.f</b> files.
<p>
   The maximum length of the lines is determined by the <i>final</i> 
   translation step and it can be set by the <b>-maxlen=...</b> flag.
   By default the output lines are at most 78 character long. Most compilers have flags 
   to accept such line length, but if this is not the case, you may 
   set '-maxlen=72' for the preprocessor step in <b>src/makefile</b>.
<p>
   The preprocessor is mainly used via the makefile, but one can translate
   a single file directly, or even use the preprocessor interactively, when
   the dimension independent notation is typed in line by line from the 
   keyboard and the expanded code appears on the screen. The interactive 
   use is a very efficient way of checking the syntax of complex dimension 
   independent notation. For interactive usage the
   number of dimensions and vector components can be overdefined temporarily 
   with the <b>-d</b> flag. For example type (<em>note the last dash!</em>)
<pre>
vacpp.pl -d=23 -
^D
1,2
^C
1,2,3
x(ixI^S,1)
x(ixImin1:ixImax1,ixImin2:ixImax2,1)
...
Ctrl-D
</pre>
   You may use <b>vacpp.pl</b> for translation directly
<pre>
vacpp.pl FILENAME.t &gt; FILENAME.f
</pre>
   or indirectly via the makefile with
<pre>
make FILENAME.f
</pre>
   You may change the maximum line length to e.g. 72 directly on the command line
<pre>
vacpp.pl -maxlen=72 FILENAME.t &gt; FILENAME.f
</pre>
   or edit the <b>src/makefile</b> accordingly.
