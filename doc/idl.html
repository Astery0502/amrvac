<h1>IDL VISUALIZATION MACROS</h1>

This document describes the use of IDL for plotting results from VAC/MPI-AMRVAC. 
IDL is not a free software, it is distributed by Research Systems Inc.
<b>You should check the VAC manual when really handling uniform grid data, it is more extensive. The functionality for amr data is limited to 1D and some 2D stuff. Some of the descriptions below may be disfunctional for true AMR data.</b>
<p>
The IDL macros provided are all in the <b>Idl_amr</b>  and <b>Idl</b> directories except 
the <b>.idlrc</b> startup file, which is supposed to be in the main directory.

<H2><A NAME="Startup">Startup</A> file</H2>

   It is useful to let IDL know about the existence of the startup file
   <b>.idlrc</b> in the main MPI-AMRVAC/ directory.  Under UNIX put 
<pre>
setenv IDL_STARTUP .idlrc
</pre>
   into your ~/.login or ~/.cshrc file if you use the csh or tcsh shell.
   For other UNIX shells, use
<pre>
IDL_STARTUP=.idlrc
export IDL_STARTUP
</pre>
   in the <b>.profile</b> file.
   Read the IDL manual if your operating system is not UNIX.
   If you start IDL in a directory where there is no .idlrc,
   IDL will give a warning message. 

<H2><A NAME="Running">Running</A> IDL</H2>

   Assuming that the IDL_STARTUP variable is properly set, simply 
   start IDL as
<pre>
idl
</pre>
   in the main MPI-AMRVAC directory. If IDL_STARTUP is not set, type
<pre>
@.idlrc
</pre>
   at the IDL&gt; prompt or start IDL like this
<pre>
idl .idlrc
</pre>
   In either case, the commands in the <b>.idlrc</b> file are
   executed: some global variables like !path are set, and 
   some procedures in <b>Idl(_amr)/procedures.pro, Idl(_amr)/animfunc.pro</b> and 
   <b>Idl/vel.pro</b> are compiled.
   The script <b>Idl_amr/defaults</b> is also executed to set some
   global variables to their default values. You can customize the startup
   of IDL by editing <b>.idlrc</b> and <b>Idl_amr/defaults</b>, e.g. you can
   compile your own IDL subroutines. 
<p>
   If you get trapped by an error inside some IDL routine,
<p><pre>
retall
</pre>
   will return to the main level. To exit IDL type
<pre>
exit
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Getpict">Reading</A> a Snapshot with getpict</H2>

   To read a single frame from a file type at the "IDL&gt;" prompt of IDL
<pre>
IDL&gt; .r getpict
</pre>
   The procedure will prompt you for the <b>filename</b>, 
   and it determines the <b>filetype</b> and <b>npictinfiles</b>
   (the number of snapshots in the file) automatically in case it is a VAC file, or detect that it is an AMR file (for which it can not determine the number of frames from the (variable) filelength). Then it asks for
   the frame-number <b>npict</b> (1, 2,... npictinfiles) 
   of the snapshot to be read from the file. When <b>npictinfiles=1</b>,
   the frame number is set to 1 automatically:
<pre>
filename(s)   ? data/exampleA22.ini
filetype(s)   = ascii
npictinfile(s)=      1
npict=       1
</pre>
   The header of the file is read and echoed on the screen, and the
   type of equation <b>physics</b> is asked, unless it is read from the
   headline of the file given as e.g. <b>ExampleA_hdadiab22</b>:
<pre>
headline  =ExampleA
ndim      = 2, neqpar= 3, nw= 3
nx        =    50   50
eqpar     =       2.0000000       1.0000000       0.0000000
variables = x y h m1 m2 gamma ghalf coriolis
physics (eg. mhd12)=hdadiab22
it      =           0, time=       0.0000000
Read x and w
GRID            INT       = Array(50, 50)
</pre>
   At the end, the <b>x</b> and <b>w</b> variables (containing the coordinates 
   and the conservative variables respectively) are read from the file. 
<p>
   If your file contained data in Cartesian coordinates, you get the "IDL&gt;"
   prompt back, and you can do whatever you want with <b>x</b>, <b>w</b>, 
   and all the other variables 
   <b>headline, it, time, gencoord, ndim, neqpar, nw, nx, eqpar, variables</b>
   defined by the header. 
<p>
   You can use the <A HREF=#Plotfunc><b>plotfunc</b></A> script to get some 
   sophisticated plots or you can use any of the IDL procedures directly, e.g.
<pre>
print,time,it
print,nx
print,variables
plot,w(*,10,0)
surface,w_1(*,*,2)-w_0(*,*,2)
contour,w(*,*,1)
vel,w(*,*,1),w(*,*,2)
</pre>
   The functions <b>diff2, diff3</b>, and <b>diff4</b> are provided for taking 
   spatial derivatives of variables represented on 2D Cartesian mesh. 
   To calculate the curl of the velocity field you could type
<pre>
vx=w(*,*,1)/w(*,*,0)
vy=w(*,*,2)/w(*,*,0)
xx=x(*,*,0)
yy=x(*,*,1)
curl_v=diff2(1,vy,xx)-diff2(2,vx,yy)
</pre>
   The difference between diff2 and diff3 is minor: diff2 uses centered 
   differences, while diff3 relies on IDL built-in procedures. <b>diff4</b>
   is a fourth order accurate centered difference formula. You can use
   these functions in the <b>Idl/animfunc.pro</b> file to define functions
   plotted by <b>plotfunc</b> and <b>animate</b>, for example the function
   'divb4' uses the diff4 function. 
   <p>
   For non-Cartesian 2D grids the functions <b>grad, div, curl</b>
   and <b>grad_rz, div_rz, curl_rz</b> are provided, which use contour
   integrals to estimate the cell averaged gradient, divergence, and curl. 
   The subscripts <b>_rz</b> refer to cylindrical symmetry in the ignored PHI 
   direction. All these
   functions are described in detail in <b>Idl/procedures.pro</b>, and
   some examples for their use can be found in <b>Idl/animfunc.pro</b>.
   For example, 'curlv' is defined with the <b>curl</b> function.
   <b>Note that the above may not work properly for AMR data, it does work with single grid VAC files</b>

<H2><A NAME="Plotfunc">Plotting</A> the Data</H2>

   Once the data is read by <A HREF=#Getpict>getpict</A> or 
   <A HREF=#Animate>animate</A> you can plot functions of <b>w</b> with
<pre>
.r plotfunc
</pre>
   You will see the value of <b>physics</b> for the last file read and some 
   parameters with standard default values for different plotting routines:
<pre>
physics (e.g. mhd12)      =hdadiab22
======= CURRENT PLOTTING PARAMETERS ================
ax,az=  30, 30, contourlevel= 30, velvector= 200, velspeed (0..5)= 5
multiplot= 0 (default), axistype (coord/cells)=coord
bottomline=2, headerline=2
</pre>
   The viewing angle is given by <b>ax</b> and <b>az</b> for the 
   plotting modes <b>plotmode=</b> 'surface', 'shade', and 'shadeirr'. 
   The <b>contourlevel</b> parameter 
   determines the number of contourlevels for the plotting modes
   'contour', 'contlabel', and 'contfill'. 
   The <b>velvector</b> and <b>velspeed</b> 
   parameters are used by the <b>vel</b> procedure to set the number
   of vectors drawn and their speed during animation in <b>animate</b>.
   The number of subplots is usually determined by the number of files and
   the number of functions, but you can override this by setting e.g.
   <b>multiplot=[2,3,0]</b>, which gives 2 by 3 subplots filled in row-wise.
   If the third element is 1, the subplots are filled in column-wise.
   Setting <b>multiplot=3</b> is identical with <b>multiplot=[3,1,1]</b>.
   <b>multiplot=0</b> gives the default behaviour.
   The plots are normally shown in physical coordinates, i.e.
   <b>axistype='coord'</b>, but the axes can also run in cell indices 
   if <b>axistype='cells'</b> is set. 
   The variables <b>bottomline</b> and <b>headerline</b> control the number
   of values shown at the bottom from <b>time, it, nx</b> and at the top 
   from <b>headline, nx</b>.
   You can change these values explicitly (e.g. <b>az=50</b>), or change 
   their default values in <b>Idl/defaults</b>. Now, you will be prompted 
   for the name of function(s) and the corresponding plotting mode(s):
<pre>
======= PLOTTING PARAMETERS =========================
wnames                     =  h m1 m2
func(s) (e.g. rho p m1;m2) ? h m1
2D plotmodes: contour/contlabel/contfill/shade/shadeirr/surface/tv/
              stream/vel/velovect/ovelovect'
plotmode(s)                ? surface
plottitle(s) (e.g. B [G];J)=default
autorange(s) (y/n)         =y
GRID            INT       = Array(50, 50)
</pre>
   The function(s) to be plotted are determined by the <b>func</b>
   string parameter, which is a list of function names separated by spaces.
   The number of functions <b>nfunc</b> is thus determined by the number of
   function names listed in <b>func</b>. 
   These function names can be any of the variable names listed in the 
   string array <b>wnames</b>, which is 
   read from the header of the file, or any of the function name strings 
   listed in the <b>case</b> statements in the <A HREF=#Animfunc>animfunc</A> 
   function in <b>Idl/animfunc.pro</b>, or any expressions using the standard
   variable, coordinate and equation parameter names valid for the particular 
   geometry and physics. These variable names are a subset of 
<pre>
xx yy zz r phi z   rho m1 m2 m3 mm e b1 b2 b3 bb  gamma eta adiab csound2
</pre>
   where "mm" and "bb" are the momentum and magnetic field squared, 
   respectively. Note that "xx ... bb" are arrays, while  "gamma ... csound2" 
   are scalars. For example 
   <b>r*m2/rho</b> is a valid expression for the angular momentum if the
   second momentum points in the phi direction, or the maximum Alfv&eacute;n 
   speed could be given as <b>func='sqrt(bb/rho)'</b>, but this is already 
   defined in animfunc.pro as 'calfven'.
<p>
   You may combine two function names with the <b>;</b> character representing
   two components of a vector, 
   e.g. <b>v1;v2</b>, which can either be plotted as a vectorfield by the
   <b>velovect</b> and <b>vel</b> procedures, or as streamlines, using
   <b>stream</b> plotmode, or otherwise the absolute value
   <b>sqrt(v1**2+v2**2)</b> is plotted by <b>surface, contour</b> etc.
   The <b>ovelovect</b> choice is identical with <b>velovect</b> except
   for the axis ranges, which are better suited for overplotting with
   a <b>contour</b> or <b>contfill</b> plot, for example.
   You can also put a minus sign in front of any function name, which
   will simply multiply the value of the rest of the string by -1. 
   For example '-T' plots (-1)*temperature.
   <i>Beware! func='-m1+m2' will actually plot -(m1+m2), 
   so use '(-m1+m2)' or 'm2-m1' instead</i>.
<p>
   For each function you may set the <b>plotmode</b> (in 1D there is no
   choice, since only the <b>plot</b> routine is useful). 
   If you give fewer plotmode(s) than <b>nfunc</b>, the rest of
   the functions will use the last plotmode given, in the above example
   <b>surface</b>. This padding rule is used for all the arrays described 
   by strings.
   The <b>plottitle</b> parameter is usually set to <b>default</b> which
   means that the function name is used for the title, but you can set it
   explicitly, e.g. <b>plottitle='Density;Momentum'</b>. Here the 
   separator character is a semicolon, thus the titles may contain spaces.
   No titles are produced if <b>plottitle=' '</b> is set.
<p>
   For each function you may set the plotting range by hand or let IDL to
   calculate the minimum and maximum by itself. This is defined by
   the <b>autorange</b> string parameter, which is a list of 'y' and 'n'
   characters, each referring to the respective function. If you set 'n'
   for any of the variables, the <b>fmin</b> and <b>fmax</b> arrays have
   to be set, e.g.
<pre>
fmin=[1. ,-1.]
fmax=[1.1, 1.]
</pre>
   Make sure that the values are floating point and not integer.
   IDL remembers the previous setting and uses it, unless the number
   of functions are changed. You can always set fmin=0, fmax=0, and let
   IDL prompt you for the values.
<p>
   It is possible to plot a part of the simulation domain. You should use domainset for that, in case of AMR data.
<p>
   The number of functions and the number of subplots can be any combination
   you would like. In 1D plots, the line style is varied for the different 
   functions, so the curves can be distinguished.
   Note, that <b>plottitle</b> is set to avoid the default titles 'h' and
   'v1;v2' overlap on top of the plot. The <b>multiplot=N</b> setting
   is equivalent with <b>multiplot=[N,1,1]</b>. In the second plot
   'ovelovect' is used (instead of 'velovect') for the velocity to get 
   good alignment with the 'contfill' plot.

<H2><A NAME="Plot more">Plotting</A> another Snapshot</H2>

   If you type
<pre>
.r getpict
.r plotfunc
</pre>
   again, the data will be read and plotted again without any questions asked,
   since IDL remembers the previous settings. 
<p>
   If you want to read another frame, say the second, from the same file, type
<pre>
npict=2
.r getpict
</pre>
   You can change the <b>func</b> and <b>plotmode</b> variables the same way:
<pre>
func='rho p'
plotmode='contour surface'
.r plotfunc
</pre>
   Note that we did not need to reread the data.
   Other variables, all listed in <b>Idl/defaults</b>, can be set similarly.
   If you set
<pre>
doask=1
<p></pre>
   the macros will ask for all the parameters to be confirmed by a simple
   RETURN, or to be changed by typing a new value. Set <b>doask=0</b> to
   get the default behaviour, which is no confirmation asked.
   To overplot previous plots without erasing the screen, set
<pre>
noerase=1
<p></pre>
   You can return to the default settings for all parameters by typing
<pre>
.r defaults
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Animate">Plotting and Animation with animate</A></H2>

   This general procedure can plot, save into file(s), or animate 
   (using IDL's Xinteranimate) different functions of data 
   read from one or more files. If a single snapshot is read, the
   plot is drawn without animation. In essence <b>animate</b> combines
   <b>getpict</b> and <b>plotfunc</b> for any number of files and any number 
   of snapshots.
<pre>
.r animate
</pre>
   will first prompt you for <b>filename(s)</b> unless already given. 
   Animating more than one input files in parallel is
   most useful for comparing simulations with the same or very similar physics
   using different methods or grid resolution. It is a good idea to save 
   snapshots at the same <i>physical</i> time into the data files, so
   use <b>dtsave</b> and <b>tsave</b> or fixed time steps <b>dtpar</b> in the 
   parameter file. The headlines and the grid sizes will be shown in 
   the headerline for each file separately above the corresponding plots.
<p>
   The function(s) to be animated and the plotmode(s) for the functions 
   are determined by the same <b>func, plotmode</b>, and <b>plottitle</b> 
   strings as for <A HREF=#Plotfunc>plotfunc</A>. If any part of the 
   <b>autorange(s)</b> string is set to <b>'y'</b>,
   the data file(s) will be read twice: first for setting the common range(s) 
   for all the snapshots and the second time for plotting.
   The first reading of the file(s) also determines <b>npict</b>, which is
   the number of snapshots to be animated. It is limited by the end of 
   file(s) and/or by the <b>npictmax</b> parameter. With a formula
<pre>
npict=min( npictmax, (min(npictinfiles)-firstpict)/dpict + 1 )
</pre>
   If <b>autorange='n'</b> for all the functions the file is only read once.
<p>
   The animation runs from <b>firstpict</b>, every <b>dpict</b>-th picture is
   plotted and the total number of animated frames is at most <b>npictmax</b>. 
   You can save the frames into a series of GIF files 
   <b>Movie/1.gif,Movie/2.gif,...</b> by setting <b>savemovie='y'</b>,
   or into PostScript files <b>Movie/1.ps,Movie/2.ps,...</b> by setting 
   <b>printmovie='y'</b>. The number of plots saved into files is limited 
   by <b>nplotmax</b>.
   The GIF files can be put together into a movie by some program, which you check with your local sysadmin.
<p>
   The <b>multiplot</b> array can be used to get some really interesting
   effects in <b>animate</b>. Besides overplotting different functions,
   as explained for <b>plotfunc</b>, the data of different files can also
   be overplotted for comparison purposes.
   Probably it is a good idea to compare 1D slices rather than full 2D plots,
   e.g. 
<pre>
filename='data/exampleA22.ini data/exampleB22.ini'
func='h v1'
cut=grid(*,25)
multiplot=2
.r animate
</pre>
   will overplot height and velocity read from the two files. 
   The lines belonging to the two data files are distinguished by
   the different line styles. Overplotting two data sets is
   especially useful when the two results are supposed to be identical.
<p>
   Timeseries can also be produced easily with <b>multiplot</b>. 
<pre>
filename='data/example22.out'
func='h'
plotmode='surface'
npictmax=6
multiplot=[3,2,0]
headerline=2
bottomline=1
.r animate
</pre>
   will show the first 6 snapshots of height in a single plot. 
   Now the time is shown for each plot individually, and setting
   <b>bottomline=1</b> limits the time stamp to the most essential
   information, time. If <b>npict*nfile*nfunc</b> is greater than the number 
   of subplots defined by <b>multiplot</b>, an animation is done. 
   This can be combined with <b>printmovie='y'</b> to produce PostScript 
   figures containing 6 subplots each, which is convenient for printing an 
   animation. Type 
<pre>
multiplot=0
</pre>
   to return to default behavior, which is one snapshot per plot.
<p>
   Even after exiting from Xinteranimate, the animation can be repeated
   again without rereading the data file(s) by typing
<pre>
xinteranimate,/keep_pixmaps
</pre>
<p>

<H2><A NAME="Animfunc">Function Definitions in animfunc</A></H2>

   Any function of the conservative variables <b>w</b>, the coordinates 
   <b>x</b>, and the equation parameters <b>eqpar</b> can be defined in the 
   <b>Idl/animfunc.pro</b> file. Extra information is provided by the equation 
   type <b>physics</b> and the variable names <b>wnames</b>. The function is 
   identified by the string <b>f</b>. The user can easily define new functions
   for a specific application by adding a new <b>case</b> statement, for
   example the accretion rate in cylindrical symmetry can be defined as
<pre>
      f eq 'rmr':  result=w(*,*,1)*r
</pre>
   Make sure that the function is in the right branch of the <b>ndim</b>
   switch. Note the use of the <b>r</b> array, which is extracted from 
   <b>x(*,*,0)</b> for convenience.
   The modified file should be recompiled and can be used as
<pre>
.r animfunc
func='rmr'
.r plotfunc
</pre>
   A few frequently used functions are defined in a rather general way, 
   they work for all the appropriate equations and number of dimensions.

</pre>
   Here <em>any</em> physics means any of <em>hdadiab, hd, mhdiso, mhd</em>.
<p>
   The vector potential A (or A*r in cylindrical coordinates) is most useful 
   with <b>plotmode='contour'</b> to plot the magnetic field lines. 
   (In case of A*r the contours are parallel to the field lines but their
   density is not proportional to the field strength).
   It is calculated by integrating the components of <b>B</b> along rows and 
   columns of the possibly irregular grid. The vector potential is well defined
   only if divergence B is zero, or negligible everywhere. Since this is not
   always true, there are a few options to calculate the vector potential.
   'A' and 'A_r' are integrated upwards starting from the bottom, 
   while 'AA', 'B', and 'AA_r' are integrated from left to right.
   This is important if the computational domain is irregular, and the
   interpolated grid contains some unphysical regions, which should be
   at the end of the integration paths. Finally 'B'
   differs from 'AA' in that the resulting vector potential is smoothed a bit

<H2><A NAME="Logfile">Reading the Logfile with getlog</A></H2>

<p>
One or more (at most three) logfiles can be read by
<pre>
.r getlog
</pre>
   which reads data from the file(s) determined by the <b>logfilename</b> 
   parameter. An initial guess for the name is made if the 
   <b>filename</b> parameter has already been given. The data in the
   logfile(s) is put into the <b>step,t,dt,wlog</b> arrays in case of 
   a single file, and into <b>step0,t0,dt0,wlog0, step1,t1,dt1,wlog1</b> 
   in case of two files.
   If the <A HREF="par.html#Stoplist">residual</A> is calculated
   and stored in the last column of the logfile, the <b>resid</b> 
   is also generated. 
   The <b>wlog(nt,nwlog)</b> array contains the rest of the columns in the 
   logfile. 
   A simple example is 
<pre>
.r getlog
logfilename(s) ? data/example22.log
headline       =ExampleA_hdadiab22
Reading arrays step,t,dt,wlog:
  wlog(*, 0)= h
  wlog(*, 1)= m1
  wlog(*, 2)= m2
Number of recorded timesteps: nt=      20
plot,t,wlog(*,0),xtitle='t',ytitle='h_mean'
</pre>
which checks the global mass conservation for exampleA.

<H2><A NAME="Print">Saving Plots into Postscript Files</A></H2>

In IDL printing a plot is possible through Postscript files.
After the plot looks fine on the screen, use for example
<pre>
set_plot,'PS'
device,filename='myfile.ps',xsize=24,ysize=18,/landscape,/color,bits=8
loadct,3
.r plotfunc
device,/close
set_plot,'X'
</pre>
For a non-color plot omit the <b>/color,bits=8</b> parameters and the 
loading of the color table by the <b>loadct</b> command. For a <i>portrait</i>
picture use <b>xsize=18,ysize=24</b> and omit the <b>/landscape</b> keyword.
If the printout is off the page, set <b>yoffset=3</b> too.
You can use .r animate instead of .r plotfunc (e.g. for multiple files or 
for time series), but make sure that only one plot is produced by setting
<b>npictmax=1</b>, and use <b>firstpict</b> to select the snapshot.
To save each frame of an animation into a different Postscript file, set
the <b>printmovie='y'</b> parameter as described <A HREF=#Animate>above</A>.
More snapshots can also be saved in a single plot using <b>multiplot</b>.
<p>
All these commands can be collected into a single file, like 
<b>Idl/myfig.pro</b>, which can be run from IDL by
<pre>
@myfig
</pre>
This is a convenient way to store the commands for producing complicated 
figures.
