<h1>AMRVACUSR MODULE</h1>

This document describes how the <b>src/usr/amrvacusr.t.PROBLEM</b> and the optional
<b>src/usr/amrvacusrpar.t.PROBLEM</b> files should be written for user defined
initial and boundary conditions, input and output file formats, and source 
terms. It also shows how the library source term routines 
<b>src/amrvacmodules/*.t</b> can be included into the AMRVACUSR module. 
These libraries (gravity, pointgrav, cooling, radloss, etc) are in principle self-documented.

<H2><A NAME="Purpose">Purpose</A> and Use</h2>

The AMRVACUSR modules contain the problem dependent user written subroutines.
Usually a single AMRVACUSR module can be designed to contain several different problems that all assume the same physics module. That would be realized by the use of the parameter <b>iprob</b>, which is to be set in the corresponding par-file. A <em>select case(iprob)</em> construct can be used in appropriate places then.
<p>
The setup is represented by two files in your simulation-directory, <b>amrvacusr.t</b> and <b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> that can be copied from specific templates in <b>src/usr/amrvacusr.t.PROBLEM</b> and <b>src/usr/amrvacusrpar.t.PROBLEM</b> or from a test in the folder <b>tests/EQUATION/PROBLEM/</b>.
The first approach is automatized by running <b>setup.pl</b>:
<pre>
$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -u=PROBLEM
</pre>
The <b>src/usr/amrvacusr.t.PROBLEM</b> file has to exist, but the 
<b>src/usr/amrvacusrpar.t.PROBLEM</b> file is optional. If it does not exist, 
the <b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> will be defaulted from <b>src/usr/amrvacusrpar.t.nul</b>.
<p>
<em>We however recommend adapting a suitable setup from the tests folder where also the parameter file (default amrvac.par) and anything else to go with the setup is present.  </em>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Creating">Creating</A> a New Setup</h2>

In your designated simulation directory, start by copying the <b>src/usr/amrvacusr.t.nul</b> file (or another similar file)
into the new <b>amrvacusr.t</b> file. It consists of a few include 
statements.
The included <b>amrvacnul/special*.t</b> files contain the default subroutines,
and some or all need to be specified for your problem.
The arguments are declared and the purpose of the subroutines is described below.
Comment out the <b>INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialSUBROUTINE.t</b> statement(s) for the 
subroutine(s) that you intend to write, and modify the comments
at the beginning and at the end of the module for clarity.


<H3><A NAME="Specialini">Specialini</A> part</h3>
Your start file should look something like this, where we already included the <b>amrvacnul/specialini.t</b> file which is always needed:
<pre>
!=============================================================================
! amrvacusr.t.MYPROBLEM
!=============================================================================
!INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialini.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/speciallog.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialbound.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialsource.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/usrflags.t
!=============================================================================
subroutine initglobaldata_usr

include 'amrvacdef.f'
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

end subroutine initglobaldata_usr
!=============================================================================
subroutine initonegrid_usr(ixG^L,ix^L,w,x)

! initialize one grid within ix^L

include 'amrvacdef.f'

integer, intent(in) :: ixG^L, ix^L
double precision, intent(in) :: x(ixG^S,1:ndim)
double precision, intent(inout) :: w(ixG^S,1:nw)
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

w(ix^S,1:nw)=zero

end subroutine initonegrid_usr
!=============================================================================
! amrvacusr.t.MYPROBLEM
!=============================================================================
</pre>
Now you should edit both subroutines according to your needs: the idea is that in
<em>initglobaldata_usr</em> you must set the global equation parameter values (i.e. all <em>eqpar(*)</em> entries, note again that you can code up different cases depending on the <b>iprob</b> parameter). In the subroutine <em>initonegrid_usr</em>, you have to make sure that at the end of this subroutine, all conservative variable values are provided on the full grid, i.e. you need to specify physically meaningfull <em>w</em> entries. You have the grid info available in the <em>x</em> variable.
<p>
You can write the subroutine(s) either in the dimension independent notation,
described in <b>AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="source.html">source</A></b>, or in 
Fortran 90 if the number of dimensions is fixed for your PROBLEM. 
<p>
Below some help is provided for writing new subroutines.
<p>
An example taken from the available <em>tests/rho/vac/amrvacusr.t</em> user module is given below
<pre>
!=============================================================================
! amrvacusr.t.testrho

! INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialini.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/speciallog.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialbound.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialsource.t
INCLUDE:amrvacnul/usrflags.t
!=============================================================================
subroutine initglobaldata_usr

include 'amrvacdef.f'
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------

{^IFONED   eqpar(v1_)=one }
{^IFTWOD   eqpar(v1_)=one; eqpar(v2_)=one }
{^IFTHREED eqpar(v1_)=one; eqpar(v2_)=one; eqpar(v3_)=one }

end subroutine initglobaldata_usr
!=============================================================================
subroutine initonegrid_usr(ixG^L,ix^L,w,x)

! initialize one grid

include 'amrvacdef.f'

integer, intent(in) :: ixG^L, ix^L
double precision, intent(in) :: x(ixG^S,1:ndim)
double precision, intent(inout) :: w(ixG^S,1:nw)

double precision:: rhoflat,rhosquare,slocx^D
double precision :: radius, xcircle^D
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------

rhoflat  = 0.5d0
rhosquare= 2.0d0
! iprob=1 is a pure 1D Riemann problem, solvable in 1D, 2D, 3D
if (iprob==1) then
    slocx^D=0.2d0;
    where({^D&x(ix^S,^D)<=slocx^D|.and.})
       w(ix^S,rho_)     = rhosquare
    elsewhere
       w(ix^S,rho_)     = rhoflat
   endwhere

! **** many more cases in the actual file are omitted here ***

else if (iprob==6) then
   radius = 0.2d0
   xcircle^D=zero;
   where(radius**2> ^D&(x(ix^S,^D)-xcircle^D)**2+ )
      w(ix^S,rho_)     = rhosquare
   elsewhere
      w(ix^S,rho_)     = rhoflat
   endwhere
else
    call mpistop("iprob not available!")
end if

end subroutine initonegrid_usr
!=============================================================================
! amrvacusr.t.testrho
!=============================================================================
</pre>
Note the use of the <kbd>rho_</kbd> index name. It is clear that the <b>x</b> 
coordinates are known on entry. The subroutine above works in 1, 2 or 3D.
<p>


<H3><A NAME="Specialbound">Specialbound</A> part</h3>

When the predefined boundary types provided by MPI-AMRVAC are not sufficient
the <b>specialbound</b> subroutine can solve the problem. It is called for
each boundary region and variable for which the boundary type 
<b>typeB='special'...</b> is selected. It is likely that you can use the 
predefined boundary types for at least some of the variables and/or regions.
The <b>specialbound</b> subroutine is called <i>after</i> the variables
with predefined boundary types have been updated in the ghost cells. 
The calling interface for the specialbound subroutine is found in the <em>amrvacnul.specialbound.t</em> file.
<p>
An example for the use of this <em>specialbound_usr</em> subroutine is found in the example user file <b>usr/amrvacusr.t.wchd22</b>, which realizes the standard 2D hydro Woodward and Collela shock reflection problem.
<p>


<H3><A NAME="Specialsource">Specialsource</A> part</h3>

There are lots of possible physical source terms for the same basic equation.
Rather than writing a new physics module for each, it is simpler to define a
problem dependent source term in the AMRVACUSR module. 
There are already a number of implemented source terms in the <A HREF=#Library>
src/amrvacusr.LIBRARY.t</A> files, which can be studied for example cases.
<p>
The <b>specialsource</b> subroutine is called at least 
once in every time step by MPI-AMRVAC. The number of calls depends on the time 
integration scheme defined by <b>typeadvance</b>, the parameter 
<b>sourcesplit</b> and also on the number of dimensions if the parameter 
<b>dimsplit=T</b>.
<p>
In any case the subroutine should integrate <b>w</b> from time <b>qt</b> to 
<b>qt+qdt</b> for the variables listed in <b>iw^LIM</b> 
in the region <b>ixO^S</b>. The source terms should be evaluated for
the <b>wCT</b> array, which corresponds to the physical time <b>qtC</b>.
In case of explicit time dependence, <b>qtC</b> should be used as time.
Only elements within <b>ixI^S</b> can be used from <b>wCT</b>.
<p>
The <b>getdt_special</b> subroutine can limit <b>dt</b> for numerical
stability if the source term requires that. This subroutine is called 
after the CFL condition <b>getdt_courant</b> and the <b>getdt</b> 
subroutine of the AMRVACPHYS module have been executed. 
<p>
The <b>specialeta</b> subroutine is used for MHD to set the 
resistivity array <b>eta</b> when it is not constant in time and/or space. 
The <b>current</b> array must then be computed, when anomalous resistivity is described as a function of <b>J</b>. 
<p>
The <b>specialrefine_grid</b> subroutine allows to add user controlled (de)refinement, by setting the integers <em>refine,coarsen</em>. You have all info available to do this refining (grid level, physical values in <em>w</em>, coordinates in <em>x</em>, time in <em>qt</em>). Similarly, the <b>specialvarforerrest</b> subroutine allows to compute a (local) new variable, to be stored in <em>var</em>, on which you can then base refinement as well. This is true for the lohner error estimator only.
<p>
<H3><A NAME="Specialio">Speciallog</A> part</h3>
The <em>amrvacnul/speciallog.t</em> file contains additional subroutines more related to special I/O requests. The default log-file may be altered, for which you need to code up the <em>printlog_special</em> subroutine. For parallel execution, this invariably means the use of MPI constructs, so you should copy in the default version from <em>amrio.t</em> and then study it, and modify accordingly. 
<p>
The <em>process_grid_usr</em> is a subroutine which allows to compute auxiliary variables
which happen to be non-local (like div v), and are in no way used for
flux computations. As auxiliaries, they are also not advanced. This functionality was added to allow for separate particle treatments using stochastic differential equations, where the particle dynamics is only relying on local compression values etc.
<p>
The <em>specialvar_output</em> is extremely handy to compute variables from the actually computed conserved variables, that can then be visualized directly. It is only used in combination with the conversion subroutines. E.g., one may here compute current density components using the actual code discretizations for computing a curl, and then visualize those with any of the visualization tools applicable. You then also need to specify a label for this variable, in <em>specialvarnames_output</em>.


<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Library">AMRVACUSR</A> Library</H2>

Various source terms are available as library subroutines, in particular for a uniform external gravitational field, for an external gravitational point mass, and for optically thin radiative losses.
They will always need to be combined with user written subroutines.
To include a library into the <b>amrvacusr.t</b> file,
just add a line
<pre>
INCLUDE:amrvacmodules/LIBRARY.t
</pre>
and call the appropriate library routines from the subroutines
<b>specialsource</b> and <b>getdt_special</b> according to the
description of the library file. An example of that for a constant external gravity is in the problem file <b>src/usr/amrvacusr.t.testhdrt</b>, which includes the gravity library.
It is also possible to copy 
the libraries into <b>amrvacusr.t</b> directly and modify them as necessary. The parameters of the library should be defined in the 
<b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> file according to the description given in the library file. See the <A HREF="equations.html#HD">equations</A> description as well, below we just list radiative loss treatments.

<h3><A NAME="Radiative">Radiative</A> losses: amrvacmodules/radloss.t and amrvacmodules/cooling.t</h3>

<p>
An optically thin gas cools due to radiative losses. This involves the
energy equation only:
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.radloss.gif">
<p>
The thermal energy loss is proportional to density squared and a complicated 
function of the temperature. The two libraries differ in the details of this function, the more general <em>amrvacmodules/cooling.t</em> has many frequently used cooling tables implemented, and various ways to add this local source term.

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Equation">Special</A> Equation Parameters</h2>

The user-defined source terms or boundary conditions may contain parameters
which are often changed and have similar meaning to the equation parameters
defined in the <b>src/EQUATION/amrvacpar.t</b> files. 
The <b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> file allows the user to define extra, problem dependent, equation parameters.
<p>
The indexname and the number of the special equation parameters can be defined
in the <b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> file. The values of these parameters
should be set in the <em>initglobaldata_usr</em> subroutine.
<p>
To prepare a new <b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> file, simply copy the 
<b>src/usr/amrvacusrpar.t.nul</b> file into <b>amrvacusrpar.t</b> and edit it. 
This file will be included into the variable declaration part of all subroutines, thus it can also be used 
for variables to be shared by subroutines in the AMRVACUSR module.
<p>
A simple example is the following file, taken from <em>src/usr/amrvacusrpar.t.testhdrt</em>
which just says the code that it has equation parameters for the constant gravitational field.
