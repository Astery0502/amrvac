This version of the MPI-AMRVAC software was initiated in the course of 2006-2007 by <B>Bart van der Holst</B> (meanwhile at University of Michigan) in a close collaboration with <A HREF="http://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0016541">Rony Keppens </A> at the
<A HREF="http://wis.kuleuven.be/cpa">Centre
for Plasma-Astrophysics (CPA)</A> at K.U.Leuven. The code has witnessed continuous improvements and additions, with <B>Zakaria Meliani</B> as the main core developer since 2005-2006 (for the relativistic physics modules, parallel conversion of MPI-AMRVAC I/O to a large variety of postprocessing formats for later visualization, and for many overall code additions/improvements), and <B>Oliver Porth</B> joining in on the core team since 2010. Other contributors to the project are
<I> Allard Jan van Marle </I> (for optically thin radiative loss treatments), <I> Peter Delmont </I>(some of the visualization capabilities), <I> Chun Xia </I>([an]isotropic thermal conduction) and the growing number of users at CPA and abroad.
<p>
The work benefitted from funding by K.U.Leuven GOA/2009/009; FWO project G.0277.08; and FP7 project <A HREF="http://swiff.eu">SWIFF</A>.
<p>
