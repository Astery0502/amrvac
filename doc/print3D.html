Please contact your printing service for specifics.</span><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements: </span>A 3D printer needs a description of a surface area in three dimensions in the form of an .stl file.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure:<br></span><ol><li>Write
your output in .vtu format and load it into the VisIt visualization
program. This software package is free and can be obtained from:&nbsp;<a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/">https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/</a></li><li>In visit, create a surface area that represents the result of your simulation. This can be done through:</li><ul><li>Add --&gt; Pseudocolor</li><li>OpAtts --&gt; Slicing --&gt; isosurface &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Make sure to draw only one isosurface. The default is ten, which will not yield a printable result.</li><li>Scale
the result to a size that fits in the printer. This can be done through
OpAtts --&gt; Transforms --&gt; Transform --&gt; Scale &nbsp; Keep in
mind that the cost of a 3D print scales with the volume.</li></ul><li>Once you are satisfied with the result, export your surface through</li><ul><li>File --&gt; Export database</li><li>Choose STL as the file format and use the option to write binary</li><li>Keep
in mind that each plot will generate its own database. If you have
multiple plots in one window, VisIt will write a separate file for each.</li></ul><li>The STL file produced by VisIt will not be directly printable. It will contain flaws that need to be repaired.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>This can be done online at either: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.netfabb.com/netfabbcloud.php">http://www.netfabb.com/netfabbcloud.php</a> or <a href="https://cloud.materialise.com/">https://cloud.materialise.com/</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, you can use a program such as Meshlab, available for free at<a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/"> http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/</a>.
This will also let you&nbsp; manipulate the STL file by hand, allowing
you to merge multiple STL files or insert additional objects. Once you
are done, it would be wise to apply one of the online services to your
end result in order to fix andy errors that you may have missed.</li></ul><li>The
process demonstrated in the previous steps will yield a printable file.
However, it may still cause problems. For example, if part of your
surface is not connected to the rest. If that happens, the printer will
create two separate objects, which may not be desirable. It is up to
the user to make sure to check this in advance.</li></ol><span style="color: black;"></span></div></div></div>
