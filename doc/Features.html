<H2><A NAME="Structure">Structure</A></h2>

This software has to be configured, preprocessed, and compiled into a single main executable program, <b>amrvac</b>
which can be run on multiple processors using MPI. 
MPI-AMRVAC will initialize and advance the unknowns, and perform automated grid refinement to follow
all details of the (possibly shock-dominated) flow. 
The program is split into several logical parts, and heavily uses Fortran 90 modules and dynamic allocation.
The various parts are simply sets of subroutines and functions that 
belong together and they are put in a single file.

</pre>
The AMRVACPHYS and AMRVACUSR modules have several versions, but only the actual
module, selected by the Perl script <b>setup.pl</b> is compiled at a time. 
See AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="USAGE.html">USAGE</A> about the configuration procedure.
<p>
Once the configuration and compilation are done, 
<b>amrvac</b> can advance the 
solution in time, or can be used to convert previously produced data files to specific other formats for visualization. The data itself will be saved into <em>*.dat</em> data files, which each contain a single snapshot of all grids and their unknowns in time, which can be used for eventual restarts.
Hence, a simulation can be continued from any saved time step. Once a snapshot is available in <em>*.dat</em> format, the result can be 
converted for further visualization, e.g. to <em>*.vtu</em> format to be visualized with Paraview, see further info on <A HREF="convert.html">conversion</A>.
<p>
<H2><A NAME="Language">Source</A> Language and Compilation</h2>

The <b>*.t</b> source files of AMRVAC are written in 
<A HREF="source.html">dimension independent notation</A>, known as the <em>LASY</em> syntax. 
A suitably modified (and also simplified) version of the VAC Pre-Processor, 
<A HREF="vacpp.html">VACPP</A> translates the source code files to
Fortran 90. The code is to be run on <b>parallel machines</b> using MPI, so even on a single processor laptop or desktop, we still require compilation for MPI.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="Equations">Equations</A></h2>

In general, MPI-AMRVAC aims to solve a system of (primarily hyperbolic) partial differential equations written
in conservation form, with optional source terms on the right hand side:
<p>

<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.general.gif" HEIGHT=60>
<p>
All the equation dependent subroutines are collected in the corresponding subdirectory (physics module), e.g. <b>src/EQUATION/amrvacphys.t</b>. Based on the existing physics module, one can easily adjust the code to allow for a new (set of) equation(s).
The following equations are already defined:
<pre>
   Module name	Equation
<hr NOSHADE>   rho		Transport equation       [d(rho)/dt+div(v*rho)=0, v fixed]
   nonlinear	Nonlinear scalar, e.g. Burgers
   hd		Hydrodynamics [Euler equations], ideal gas <em>-eos=gamma (default)</em>, isentropic [p=const*rho^gamma] or isothermal eos [p=const*rho] <em>-eos=iso</em>
   mhd		Magnetohydrodynamics, ideal gas <em>-eos=gamma (default)</em>, isentropic [p=const*rho^gamma] or isothermal eos [p=const*rho] <em>-eos=iso</em>, also zero-beta plasma
   srhd		special relativistic hydrodynamics, ideal gas EOS
   srhdeos	special relativistic hydrodynamics, Synge-type TM EOS
   srmhd	special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, ideal gas <em>-eos=gamma (default)</em>, Synge-type TM EOS <em>-eos=synge</em> and isentropic <em>-eos=iso</em>
</pre>
The resistivity for mhd can be a function of the flow variables as well as position. 
Some typical source terms have been implemented as a AMRVACUSR LIBRARY, collected in the <b>src/amrvacmodules/</b> folder:
<pre>
   Library       Equation(s)  Source terms
<hr NOSHADE>   
   radloss       hd, mhd  optically thin radiative losses 
   gravity       hd, mhd  external gravity, constant magnitude and direction 
   pointgrav     hd, mhd  external gravity for (several) point sources
   heatconduct   hd, mhd  (an)isotropic thermal conduction
   viscosity     hd, mhd  viscosity
   epsinf        srmhd    synchrotron losses of the cutoff electron energy
   raytracing    all      solve equations on a raygrid, coupling in both directions with the fluid
   fff           mhd      linear force free field extrapolation
   pfss          mhd      potential field spherical surface extrapolation
</pre>
These can be modified and included into the AMRVACUSR module.
<p>
See AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="equations.html">equations</A> for more detail.

<H2><A NAME="Grid">Grid</A> and Boundary</h2>

<b>The base grid is a 1, 2, or 3 dimensional curvilinear grid, with slab or axial
symmetry for the ignored direction in less than 3D.</b> The grid can be Cartesian, cylindrical, spherical in 3D, or a polar grid in 2D.
The vector variables are represented by their respective cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical
components. Numerical conservation is ensured over the grid hierarchy by a finite volume discretization. 
<p>
The <b>slab</b>, <b>cylindrical</b> or <b>spherical</B> grids differ in the 
definition of volumes and surfaces for the grid cells, and there are
some extra terms in the equations, like the p/r term in the radial 
momentum equation for hydrodynamics. These are defined in the 
<b>addgeometry</b> subroutines for each AMRVACPHYS module. For polar grids
the same geometrical source terms are used.
<p>
The boundaries are represented by ghost cells around the physical mesh.
Of course, for a grid-adaptive computation, internal boundaries are handled appropriately, and the user is
expected to interfere only with the physical domain boundaries, which represent 2, 4, or 6 regions depending on the dimensionality (1,2 or 3).
The boundary types are defined for each region and each variable separately. The 
following boundary types are available:
<pre>
   Type		Value of the ghost cell
<hr NOSHADE>   periodic	Copied from opposite edge of the mesh
   symm		Reflected from closeby mesh cells
   asymm	Reflected from closeby cells and multiplied by -1
   cont		Copied from mesh cell next to the ghost cell
   special	Defined by the specialbound subroutine in AMRVACUSR module
</pre>

See AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="discretization.html#Grid">discretization</A> and
AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="axial.html">axial</A> for further information.

<H2><A NAME="Spatial">Spatial</A> Discretization</h2>

<b>In MPI-AMRVAC, most discretizations are shock capturing conservative 
numerical schemes</b>. A non exhaustive list is given by:
<pre>
   Name	            Description
<hr NOSHADE>   
   cd          Central difference
   tvdlf       MUSCL type TVD-Lax-Friedrich
   tvdlf1      First order TVD-Lax-Friedrich
   tvdmu       TVD-MUSCL with Hancock predictor
   tvdmu1      First order upwind scheme
   tvd	       One-step temporally 2nd order TVD
   tvd1	       One-step temporally 1st order TVD
   fd          conservative finite differences, up to fifth order with MP5 reconstruction
</pre>
<p>
In multidimensional MHD calculations the divergence of the magnetic field
may become significantly different from zero. This may cause numerical 
instability or inaccurate results. There are several source-term options to fix this problem.
E.g., <b>Powell's</b> non-conservative source terms, which are proportional to 
<b>div B</b>, can be used to stabilize, and to improve the 
accuracy for any of the methods.  We have also provide several variants of <b>Dedner's</b> GLM scheme.  
<p>
See AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="methods.html">methods</A> for a more detailed description.

<H2><A NAME="Temporal">Temporal</A> Discretization</h2>

With the finite volume methods, second order accurate explicit time integration can be obtained by
predictor-corrector and multistep Runge-Kutta type discretizations.
In finite differences, the overall accuracy can go up to fourth order using the appropriate temporal discretizations.  
The more important ones are:
<pre>
   Name	                Description
<hr NOSHADE>   onestep                    1st order Euler scheme
   twostep		      2nd order predictor-corrector schemes
   threestep                  3rd order (TVD) Runge-Kutta
   rk4                        4th order Runge-Kutta (classical)
   ssprk43                    3rd order, strong stability preserving four step Runge-Kutta
   ssprk54                    4th order, strong stability preserving five step Runge-Kutta
</pre>
The time step can be adjusted dynamically to satisfy the stability criteria.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="Plans">Plans</A> for Future Versions</h2>

There are several planned extensions. Some of the more important and 
clearly defined directions are listed below.
