<h1>How to migrate to the git version</h1>

  New switches for setup.pl (former setamrvac): <br>
For MHD and HD, the equation of state is controlled via:
  <br>
-eos=gamma/iso where gamma is the ideal gas with adiabatic index
eqpar(gamma_)
  <br>
iso inherits the functionality from the hdadiab or mhdiso modules.
Currently -eos=default will result in -eos=gamma (but this could
change in the relativistic modules).  
This is still to be implemented for the relativistic modules sr(m)hd
and sr(m)hdeos
  <br>
 -nf=0(default)  :: number of tracers which move with fluid element
 adds variables tr1_ to trn_.Select regions that you want to trace and let
 w(ix^D,tr1_)=one (primitive variable) or w(ix^D,Dtr1_)=w(ix^D,rho_) (conservative
 variable) there. In .par file, add names for tr1_ in primnames and  wnames and a
 suitable boundary type for tr1_ in parameter typeB.
  <br>
 -arch=default/macbook/debug/...:: select a compiling mode defined in arch/*.defs.
 you can easily add more machine specific definition files here.
  <br>
  -ndust=0(default) :: number of dust species to use in hd physics
  module

  <p>

   Make a folder for your own problem anywhere you want, for example, 
  ~/simulations/CME/. In this folder type 
 <pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup -d=33 -z=0 -phi=0 -g=16,16,16 -p=hd -u=CME -s</pre>
 to set up the compiling environment.
 <br>
  Your original usr files 
 <em>$AMRVAC_DIR/src/usr/amrvacusr.t.CME</em> and <em>amrvacusrpar.t.CME</em> will be copied into 
 this folder ~/simulation/CME/ as amrvacusr.t and amrvacusrpar.t.
  <br>
  From then on you just need to modify these two files to change your code. Besides, you need
 to create a parameter file named as amrvac.par (or a symbolic link file linked 
 to your parameter file with another name) in the folder. 
 <p>
 Then compile your code:
 <pre>make</pre>
 and run on 2 processors:
 <pre>mpirun -np 2 amrvac </pre>
 If you changed the compiling environment, you should make clean before compile.
 You may also create a folder datamr/ in ~/simulations/CME/ to output data in
 it. By default, the output will be stored in dataxxxx.dat in the
 simulation directory and since we recommend to run each simulation in
 is own folder (~/simulations/CME1/, ~/simulations/CME2/ ...) creating
 a datamr is not longer required.
  
  </li>
  <li>
  Modify your amrvacusr.t <br>
 The way to include modules at the beginning of amrvacusr.t is changed a little:
 <pre>INCLUDE:amrvacusr.gravity.t => INCLUDE:amrvacmodules/gravity.t </pre>
 <pre>INCLUDE:amrvacnul.specialbound.t => INCLUDE:amrvacnul/specialbound.t </pre>
 et al. 
 A new module must be included:
 <pre>INCLUDE:amrvacnul/usrflags.t</pre>
 Variable iw can not be used in subroutine specialbound_usr anymore. Just delete 
 "select case(iw) .. case(rho_) .. end select". And an new subroutine bc_int must be included.
 See an example in <br> <pre>amrvacnul/specialbound.t</pre>
 Add x argument in these subroutines:
 <pre>
call conserve(ixG^L,ix^L,w,patchw) => call conserve(ixG^L,ix^L,w,x,patchw)
call primitive(ixI^L,ixI^L,w) => call primitive(ixI^L,ixI^L,w,x)
call getpthermal(w,ixG^L,ixO^L,pth) => call getpthermal(w,x,ixG^L,ixO^L,pth)
call smallvalues(w,ixI^L,ixO^L,"aa") => call smallvalues(w,x,ixI^L,ixO^L,"aa")</pre>

  </li>
  <li>
 Modify your amrvac.par <br>
 The way adding split and unsplit source terms is improved. Parameters "sourcesplit" and "sourceunsplit" are removed.
 The sources, if any, can be added in a split or unsplit way according to the logical parameters "ssplitdivb", "ssplitdust", "ssplitresis", and "ssplituser"
 which correspond to divb source to maintain divergence free of magnetic field, dust effect, resistivity, and other sources added by user, respectively.
 The way of cleaning the divergence of magnetic field divB is improved and rearranged. 
 The parameter "divfix" is removed.  
 <em>typedivbfix='powel'(default)/'janhunen'/'linde'/'none'/'glm1'(default)/'glm2'/'glm3'</em>
 If choose 'linde',  two extra parameters will work: <br>
 <em>divbdiff=0.5d0(default)</em> :: coefficient to control diffusion
 speed <br>
 <em>typedivbdiff='all'(default)/'ind'</em> :: add/exclude divB diffusive term in 
 energy equation.<br>
 If you choose <em>'glm1'/'glm2'/'glm3'</em>, a line, <pre>#define GLM</pre> must exits in definitions.h, a 
 new variable <em>psi</em> must exist in <em>amrvac.par</em> after magnetic field <em>b2</em> (if 2 
 directions) or <em>b3</em> (if 3 directions), and its corresponding boundary type <em>typeB</em> 
 must be set up (as <em>'cont'</em> or <em>'periodic'</em>).
 If choose other than glm, <em>#define GLM</em> in definitions.h must be changed, e.g, 
 into <em>#undefine GLM</em> or deleted.
  </li>
  <li>
Check definitions.h <br>
This is used to define additional switches.  Currently there are the
following switches:  <br>
switch on Hall MHD (<em>#define HALL</em>), <br>
switch on the GLM treatment (<em>#define GLM</em>), <br>
add synchrotron cooling to srmhd and srhdeos physics
modules (<em>#define EPSINF</em>) <br>
or switch the binary vtu output to big endian (#define BIGENDIAN).  <br>
This list will grow.  An empty definitions.h should behave as it used
to. If definitions.h is changed, you need to recompile the code to make it effective. 
  </li>
  <li>
  A new parameter <em>ditregrid</em> is introduced to reconstruct the whole AMR grids
 once every ditregrid iteration(s) instead of regridding every iteration.
  </li>
  <li>
subroutine specialbound_usr for special boundaries in amrvacusr.t should be modified, as the select case(iw) has been removed.
A correct example is given as follows: 
  <pre>
subroutine specialbound_usr(qt,ixI^L,ixO^L,iw,iB,w,x)

! special boundary types, user defined
! user must assign conservative variables in bounderies

include 'amrvacdef.f'

integer, intent(in) :: ixI^L, ixO^L, iw, iB
double precision, intent(in) :: qt, x(ixI^S,1:ndim)
double precision, intent(inout) :: w(ixI^S,1:nw)
!----------------------------------------------------------------------------

! just to give an example for 3D MHD :
select case(iB)
 case(1)
   ! min boundary in the 1st dimension 
   w(ixO^S,rho_)=1.d0
   w(ixO^S,v1_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,v2_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,v3_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,p_)=2.d0
   w(ixO^S,b1_)=1.d0
   w(ixO^S,b2_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,b3_)=0.d0
   call conserve(ixI^L,ixO^L,w,x,patchfalse)
 case(2)
   ! max boundary in the 1st dimension
   w(ixO^S,rho_)=1.d0
   w(ixO^S,v1_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,v2_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,v3_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,p_)=2.d0
   w(ixO^S,b1_)=1.d0
   w(ixO^S,b2_)=0.d0
   w(ixO^S,b3_)=0.d0
   call conserve(ixI^L,ixO^L,w,x,patchfalse)
 ...
end select
end subroutine specialbound_usr
   </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
