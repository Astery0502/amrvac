<h1>Auxiliary variables in MPI-AMRVAC: <b>nwflux, nwaux, nwextra, nwauxio, nw</b> </h1>

This document describes the differences and the intended use of the <b>nwaux, nwextra</b> parameters for MPIAMRVAC.
These global parameters are dependent on the physics module, and defined in the corresponding
<pre>
  amrvacpar.t.physics
</pre>
file, where <em>physics</em> is currently one of <em>rho, hdadiab, hd, mhd, srhd, srhdeos, srmhd, srmhdeos</em>.

This global parameter sets the total number of variables, determining the (last dimension-independent) size of the <em>w(ixG^T,1:nw)</em> array, and is always 
<pre>
 nw = nwflux+nwaux+nwextra
</pre>
The idea is that there are <em>nwflux</em> conservative variables for which corresponding fluxes are defined in the <em>amrvacphys.t.physics</em>
module, and that we have in addition a set of <em>nwaux</em> auxiliary variables, together with some extra <em>nwextra</em> variables. For these latter two types of variables, one does not have a corresponding flux definition in <em>getflux, gefluxforhllc</em> subroutines, and they also have no boundary conditions imposed on them.

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="nwflux">nwflux</A></h2>

The first <em>1:nwflux</em> variables should be the conservative variables of the physics module at hand, and these are the ones that are updated
by means of fluxes across cell boundaries, and are influenced by source terms (geometric or real physical source terms).
Also, those variables change their
meaning/content in the subroutines <em>primitive, conserve</em>. These latter subroutines are thus switching from conservative to primitive and vice versa at
appropriate places in the code, and in this switching procedure, handy use can be made of the possible auxiliary variables. By default, only the
special relativistic physics modules <em>srhd, srhdeos, srmhd, srmhdeos</em> have such auxiliary variables defined for them, i.e. for these modules we have
<em>nwaux>0</em>, and auxiliary variables are then in the slots <em>nwflux+1:nwflux+nwaux</em>. For the first <em>1:nwflux</em> variables, the boundary conditions are to be imposed and existing boundary types have to be provided (like <em>symm, asymm, special, cont, periodic, ...</em>) in the par-file.

For steady-state computations, the residual is based on only the temporal variation of these <em>1:nwflux</em> variables.

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="nwaux">nwaux</A></h2>

When for the physics module at hand, one has <em>nwaux>0</em>, the slots in the <em>w</em>-array corresponding to <em>nwflux+1:nwflux+nwaux</em> contain
so-called auxiliary variables. One should distinguish between two types of such auxiliary variables, namely those that are <b>local</b> and those that are
<b>nonlocal</b>. 

<ol><h3>For <b>local</b> auxiliaries, which can be
computed directly from instantaneous local values of the first <em>1:nwflux</em> variables.</h3>
In the physics modules for <em>srhd, srhdeos, srmhd, srmhdeos</em> (special relativistic modules), these local auxiliaries are useful to store pressure or Lorentz factor values, which in principle are computable from
the set of conservative variables at any time. As a costly non-linear iterative (Newton-Raphson) procedure is involved, it pays off in computing
time to have corresponding auxiliary variables available when e.g. fluxes have to be defined/added in <em>getflux</em> and so on. These local auxiliary variables
are all to be computed in the <em>getaux</em> subroutine in the physics module. When <em>nwaux>0</em>, auxiliaries are computed
by means of a <em>getaux</em> call at various places in e.g. <em>tvdlf.t</em>. Since they are to be used for facilitating flux specifications, they
also need to be known in the ghost cells. This is taken care of by the <em>fix_auxiliary</em> call in the boundary condition treatment: note that
they are thus computed from local (ghostcell) values from conservative variables (themselves computed according to their boundary type), so that we do not
need to specify a boundary type for the <em>nwflux+1:nwflux+nwaux</em> variables. In practice, since boundary types are defined for <em>nw</em>
variables per side, just enter e.g. the string <em>'dummy'</em> for the auxiliaries.
The local auxiliaries can in fact also be used to trigger refinement or coarsening, so that the corresponding <em>flags</em> integer array may use them.

<h3>For <b>nonlocal</b> auxiliaries, which contain gradients of
the first <em>1:nwflux</em> variables.</h3>
We added the possibility to compute, in every timestep, and immediately prior to saving a snapshot (and following the <em>setdt</em> subroutine), local
variables that depend on gradients of the first variables. These can store things like divergence of the velocity, curl of the magnetic field (current),
which can be useful for visualization later on. These nonlocal auxiliary variables should not be computed in the <em>getaux</em> subroutine, since
the geometric info is not available there. Similarly to the local auxiliaries, they are not advanced, there are no boundary conditions imposed on them 
(in fact, these variables can typically not be computed meaningfully in the ghost cells due to stencil restrictions), and they need to be computed/specified in
the <em>process_grid_usr</em> subroutine, for which the default interface is provided in the <em>amrvacnul.speciallog.t</em> module. These
nonlocal variables should not be used for facilitating flux computations, nor are they very useful for triggering refinement (as they will not be truly
up-to-date at all instances in a multi-step timestep procedure, because they are not computed in the <em>getaux</em> subroutine). These kind of nonlocal
auxiliaries may come in handy for particle acceleration treatments that do not react back on the flow dynamics, which involves the
seperate evolution of particle distributions according to the velocity field and local compression.

Finally, an extra set of <em>nwextra</em> variables can be defined in addition to the presently available ones in physics modules like
<em>hd, mhd</em> by setting <em>nwextra>0</em>. Like auxiliaries, they are not advanced (no fluxes need to be defined for them in <em>getflux</em> and so),
there are no boundary conditions imposed on them (again, enter corresponding strings <em>'dummy'</em> in their boundary setting in the par file), and they should not be used for basing refinement/derefinement on. They are not computed in the ghost cells, and they can be used to store additional
physical variables like old pressure or temperature values, the accumulated luminosity (internal energy change) during a timestep, etc. They
were added specifically for facilitating the post-processing of simulations involving (optically thin) radiative losses. 

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="nwauxio">nwauxio</A></h2>

Only for post-processing purposes on saved snapshots from the code, one may want to compute additional auxiliary variables for visualization.
Hence, only at the <A HREF="convert.html">convert-stage</a> (from amrvac <b>.dat</b> data file to any of the available formats in the <em>convert</em> subroutine) do we need to
enlarge the data size from <em>nw</em> to <em>nw+nwauxio</em>, and their calculation is to be done in the <em>specialvar_output</em> subroutine,
for which the default interface is given in the <em>amrvacnul.speciallog.t</em> module. Correspondingly, the names have to be given in the
<em>specialvarnames_output</em> as strings to be concatenated with the <em>wnames/primnames</em> strings. This means that normally <em>nwauxio=0</em>,
but it can be at convert stage set to a nonzero value in the <em>filelist</em> part of the par-file.
