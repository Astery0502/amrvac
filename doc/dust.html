<h1>MPI-AMRVAC DUST IMPLEMENTATION</h1>This is an overview of the option that allows users to model dust+gas flows in mpi-amrvac.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physics:</span><br>Dust
in mpi-amrvac is treated as a pressureless gas that coexists with the
actual gas. Dust and gas are linked through a dragforce that is
calculated based on the phsyical characteristics of the gas and the
dust grains according to Kwok 1975,page 584 (between eqn
8 and 9), but with several options for the sticking coefficient. The
interaction between dust and gas is considered purely kinetic, without
the influence of magnetic fields. It is
possible to combine multiple dust species in a single simulation. This
approach dust not take into account the interaction between different
dust species, which will simply ignore each other's presence. Neither
does it take into account the ability of grains of a single species to
interpenetrate. A collision between two dust flows of the same dust
species will therefore result in a sharp feature that is not physical
as the dust is brought to a stop by the collision. For these reasons
dust+gas simulations should be treated with caution.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Numerics:<br></span>Currently
the only physics module that allows for the presence of dust is HD, due
to the lack of a clear formulation of the coupling between dust and
magnetic fields. Each dust species has its own continuity and momentum
equation, but lacks an energy equation because of the lack of a
pressure equivalent. During each timestep the dragforce between dust
and gas is calculated as a local value and applied to the momentum
equations of both dust and gas. It is also taken into account when
calculating the size fo teh next timestep in order to guarantee
numerical stability.<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Practical use:<br></span>In order to add dust to a
simulation, the user has to do the following:<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><ol><li>In <span style="text-decoration: underline;">definitions.h</span> remove the line #undefine
DUST</li><li>recompile with <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">$AMRVACDIR/setup.pl -p=hd -ndust=#</span>, with # the number of
dustspecies</li><li>In the subroutine <span style="font-style: italic;">initglobaldata_usr</span> define the size&nbsp;of each dust species
(<span style="color: red;">sdust(1:^NDS)</span>) and the internal density of
each dust species (<span style="color: red;">rhodust(1:^NDS</span>) as well as
the scaling factors <span style="color: red;">normvar(rho^DS)</span> and <span style="color: red;">normvar(v^Cd^DS)</span>. Note that both size and density of
each species have to be scaled. The user may also need to set the values<span style="color: red;"> Lstar</span> and/or <span style="color: red;">Tdust</span></li><li>In the subroutine <span style="font-style: italic;">initonegrid_usr</span> set the initial values for the dust densities
(<span style="color: red;">w(ix^S,rho^DS)</span>) and velocities (<span style="color: red;">w(is^S,v^Cd^DS)</span>). This may also need to be done in a
special boundary, depending on the nature of the simulation.</li><li>Adjust the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">amrvac.par</span> file to determine how the dust is treated. This involves the following parameters, which have to be included in <span style="color: red;">methodlist<span style="color: black;">.</span></span></li><ol><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">dustmethod<span style="color: black;">,
which can be set to 'Kwok','sticking', 'linear',or 'none'. In case of
'Kwok', the dragforce will be calculated according to&nbsp; </span></span></span></span>Kwok
1975,page 584 (between eqn
8 and 9). In case of 'sticking', the same equations apply, but the
sticking coefficient will be calculated according to Decin et al. 2006.
In case of 'linear', the dragforce will simply scale with the velocity
difference and in case of 'none', no drag force will exist at all.</li><li><span style="color: red;">dustzero<span style="color: black;">,
if set to .true. will reduce the dust density to zero if it drops below
the level of smallrhod in order to avoid numerical problems at
extremely low densities</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">dustspecies</span>,
which can be 'graphite' or 'silicate' affects the dust temperature.
Note that it is up to the user to make sure that the dustspecies and
internal density are compatible.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">dusttemp</span>, is either 'constant', 'ism', or 'stellar'. Determines the dust temperature. If 'constant', it will be set to teh values of <span style="color: red;">Tdust</span>
(in Kelvin). If 'ism', it will be calculated accoridng to Tielens
(2005) eqn. 5.41 and 5.42. If 'stellar', it will be calculated
according to Tielens (2005), eqn. 5.44 using a stellar luminosity of <span style="color: red;">Lstar</span> in solar luminosities.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">smallrhod</span> is the cutoff below which the dust density will be set to zero, if <span style="color: red;">dustzero</span> == T</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">In addition, the suer has to account for the additional variable. For example:&nbsp;</span></span></li><ol><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">primnames</span>='rho v1 v2 p rhod1 rhod2 v1d1 v1d2&nbsp; v2d1 v2d2&nbsp;'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">wnames</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 'rho m1 m2 e rhod1 rhod2 m1d1 m1d2 m2d1 m2d2'</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">typeB</span>=&nbsp;&nbsp; 10*'special',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10*'cont',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;'symm','symm', 'asymm','symm',2*'symm',2*'symm',2*'asymm',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 'symm','symm', 'asymm','symm',2*'symm',2*'symm',2*'asymm'</span></span></li><li><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="color: red;">flags(11)</span>=1<br><span style="color: red;">flags(1)</span>=1<br></span></span></li></ol></ol></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><hr>
