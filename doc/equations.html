This document describes the equations implemented in the <b>src/EQUATION/amrvacphys.t</b>
and <b>src/EQUATION/amrvacpar.t</b> files, and gives tips on how a new module can be 
created. Information about LIBRARY and USER defined source terms are in
AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF=amrvacusr.html>amrvacusr</A>. In principle, the code handles anything of generic form

<H2><A NAME="RHO">Transport</A> Equation: rho</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=rho</pre>
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.rho.gif" HEIGHT=30>
<p>
The transport equation describes the transport of a scalar field, 
here the density <b>rho</b> by a prescribed velocity field. 
This equation is used for test purposes.
<p>
The <b>eqpar(v1_), eqpar(v2_), ...</b>
equation parameters (there are as many as there are dimensions NDIM) define the components of the uniform velocity field.
<p>
For a linear scalar equation the Riemann solver is trivial, thus all TVD type 
methods give identical results.
<hr>





<H2><A NAME="NONLINEAR">Nonlinear scalar</A> Equation: nonlinear</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=nonlinear</pre>
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.nonlinear.gif" WIDTH=200>
<p>
The nonlinear scalar equation is either the inviscid Burgers equation, or the non-convex equation,
depending on the <b>eqpar(fluxtype_)</b>
equation parameter (1 for Burgers, 2 for nonconvex).
<p>
There is also a version coupling the nonlinear set with the advection equation: <b>nonlinear+rho</b>.  This was used to study basic coupling strategies.  
<hr>






<H2><A NAME="HDADIAB">Adiabatic</A> Hydrodynamics: hd</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=hd -eos=iso</pre>
Includes the equations for pressureless dust and the Shallow Water equations
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.hdadiab.gif" HEIGHT=100>
<p>
The system of adiabatic hydrodynamical equations are solved for the density
<b>rho</b> and the momentum density <b>m=rho*v</b>. 
The pressure is a function of
density only since an isentropic initial condition is assumed. There are two
equation parameters, the adiabatic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b> (the isothermal case corresponds to <b>eqpar(gamma_)=1</b>) and the adiabatic
constant <b>eqpar(adiab_)</b> (which should be positive or zero). It is possible to set <b>eqpar(adiab_)=0</b> and handle the case of pressureless dust.
<p>
The system of <b>shallow water equations</b> is a special case with the following
identifications: <b>rho=h</b> represents the height of the water column, 
<b>eqpar(gamma_)=2</b> and the adiabatic coefficient is half of the gravitational 
acceleration <b>eqpar(adiab_)=g/2</b>.
<p>
There is a Roe-type Riemann solver implemented, in <em>hd/roe.t</em>.
Several routines specific to HLLC are in <em>hd/hdhllc.t</em>.
<hr>







<H2><A NAME="HD">Hydrodynamics</A>: hd</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=hd -eos=gamma</pre>
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.hd.gif" WIDTH=233 HEIGHT=130>
<p>
The Euler equations are solved for density <b>rho</b>, the momentum density 
<b>m=rho*v</b> and the total energy density <b>e</b>. The pressure is a 
derived quantity which is calculated from the conservative variables. 
<p>
There is a single equation parameter, the adiabatic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b> (typical value is 5/3). The Riemann solver uses the Roe-average, and is implemented in <em>hd/roe.t</em>. 
Several routines specific to HLLC are in <em>hd/hdhllc.t</em>.
<p>
This equation module can be combined with the LIBRARY source definitions for (local) optically thin radiative losses, see AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="mpiamrvac_radcool.html">mpiamrvac_radcool.html</A>. Schematically, it introduces terms as
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.radloss.gif" HEIGHT=121>
<p>
In this case two scaling parameters relate to temperature and the radiative loss function, namely <em>eqpar(Tscale_)</em> and <em>eqpar(Lscale_)</em>.
<p>
The HD module can also be combined with the external gravity modules, either for uniform gravity (<em>amrvacusr.gravity.t</em>) or for point gravity, see AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="mpiamrvac_pointgrav.html">mpiamrvac_pointgrav.html</A>. These are
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.gravity.gif" HEIGHT=60>
<p>
and for point gravity
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.pointgrav.gif" HEIGHT=110>
<p>
Note how the gravitational constant and the non-dimensionalization is taken into the parameters <em>M_point</em> and its location <em>x_point</em>.

<H2><A NAME="MHDISO">Isothermal Magnetohydrodynamics</A>: mhd</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -mhd -eos=iso</em></pre>
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.mhdiso.gif" WIDTH=514>
<p>
This is the system of the MHD equations without the full energy equation, and with the following conservative 
variables: density <b>rho</b>, momentum density <b>m=rho*v</b>, and the magnetic field <b>B</b>. 
The magnetic field is measured in units for which the magnetic 
permeability is 1. The density pressure relation is polytropic.
<p>
The source terms on the right hand side with
<b>eta</b> in them are the resistive terms.

<p>
There are three equation parameters: the polytropic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b> (which must be larger or equal to 1), 
and the resistivity <b>eqpar(eta_)</b>, and the entropy <b>eqpar(adiab_)</b>. Ideal MHD corresponds to 
<b>eqpar(eta_)=0</b>,
positive values give a uniform resistivity, while a negative value calls the 
<b>specialeta</b> procedure in the <A HREF="amrvacusr.html#Specialsource">
AMRVACUSR module</A> to determine the resistivity as a function of the 
coordinates, of the conservative variables, and/or of the current density.
This subroutine is to be completed by the user.
<hr>
<p>






<H2><A NAME="MHD">Magnetohydrodynamics</A>: mhd</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=mhd -eos=gamma</pre>
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.mhd.gif" WIDTH=514 HEIGHT=171>
<p>
This is the full system of the MHD equations, with the following conservative 
variables: density <b>rho</b>, momentum density <b>m=rho*v</b>, total energy 
density <b>e</b> and the magnetic field <b>B</b>. 
The magnetic field is measured in units for which the magnetic 
permeability is 1. 
<p>
The source terms on the right hand side with
<b>eta</b> in them are the resistive terms.
<p>
There are two equation parameters: the adiabatic index <b>eqpar(gamma_)</b> (which must be strictly positive and different from 1), 
and the resistivity <b>eqpar(eta_)</b>. Ideal MHD corresponds to 
<b>eqpar(eta_)=0</b>,
positive values give a uniform resistivity, while a negative value calls the 
<b>specialeta</b> procedure in the <A HREF="amrvacusr.html#Specialsource">
AMRVACUSR module</A> to determine the resistivity as a function of the 
coordinates, of the conservative variables, and/or of the current density.
This subroutine is to be completed by the user.
<p>
There is a Roe-type Riemann solver implemented using arithmetic averaging, in <em>mhd/roe.t</em>, while several routines specific to HLLC are in <em>mhd/mhdhllc.t</em>.
<p>
This equation module can be combined with the LIBRARY source definitions for (local) optically thin radiative losses, see AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="mpiamrvac_radcool.html">mpiamrvac_radcool.html</A>. It can also be combined with the external gravity modules, either for uniform gravity (<em>amrvacusr.gravity.t</em>) or for point gravity, see AMRVAC_Man/<A HREF="mpiamrvac_pointgrav.html">mpiamrvac_pointgrav.html</A>.
<p>
We also have implemented the splitting strategy, where a static, potential background field is assumed. This modifies the equations and brings in extra sources and flux terms.

<H2><A NAME="SRHD">Special Relativistic Hydro</A>: srhd(eos)</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=srhd</pre>
<pre>or</pre>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=srhdeos</pre>
<p>

<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.srhd.gif" HEIGHT=300>
<p>
This equation module has to deal with the non-trivial relation between primitive variables and conservative variables. Therefore, two auxiliary variables are taken along, which are the Lorentz factor and the pressure. The transformation from primitive to conservative also depends on the actual equation of state assumed. The <em>srhd</em> module assumes an ideal gas with constant adiabatic index, the <em>srhdeos</em> builds in the Mathews EOS. These are
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.EOS.gif" HEIGHT=300>
<p>
It is straightforward to generalize the EOS used, by suitably modifying only subroutines in the <em>srhdeos/srhdeos.t</em> module.
<hr>


<H2><A NAME="SRMHD">Special relativistic ideal MHD</A>: srmhd</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=srmhd -eos=gamma/synge/iso</pre>
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.srmhd.gif" HEIGHT=350>
<p>
This equation module has to deal with the non-trivial relation between primitive variables
 and conservative variables. Therefore, two auxiliary variables are taken along, which are the Lorentz factor and the <em>ksi</em> variable. The transformation from primitive to conservative
also depends on the actual equation of state assumed. Several equations of state are implemented: Ideal gas (<em>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -eos=gamma</em>), approximate Synge gas (<em>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -eos=synge</em>) and isentropic flow (<em>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -eos=iso</em>). 
<p>
It is straightforward to generalize the EOS used, by suitably modifying only the <em>srmhd/eos.t</em> module.
<hr>

<H2><A NAME="SRRMHD">Special relativistic resistive MHD</A>: srrmhd</h2>
<pre>$AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -p=srrmhd -eos=gamma/synge</pre>
The implemented algorithm is adopted from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.382..995K">Komissarov (2007)</a> and evolves both magnetic and electric fields.  A GLM treatment to constrain the divergences of B and E is used.  
<p>
  <IMG SRC="figmovdir/srrmhd.png" HEIGHT=350>
<p>
  Two constraint equations are evolved, for variables psib_ and phi_.  As in the SRMHD case, two axiliary variables lfac_ and xi_ are used for the conversion between conserved and primitive variables.
  Current is given by the Ohm's law:
<p>
  <img src="figmovdir/srrmhd-current.png" HEIGHT=50>
<br>
  which is simply J=1/eta E in the fluid frame.  
  The quantities in the fluxes read
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/srrmhd-quantities.png" HEIGHT=250>
<p>
  Resistivity is controlled with the parameter eqpar(eta_).  
  The SRRMHD module can be combined with the Synge EOS and the gamma-law.  So far the implementation is only for cartesian grids.  Generalisation to spherical and cylindrical grids is straight-forward though and should just implement the subroutine <emph>addgeometry</emph>.  
  As the equation for the electric field becomes stiff for small resistivities, the time-step can become prohibitively small for eta_<1e-3.  This is typically tackled with a mixed implicit-explicit timestepping scheme as for example by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.394.1727P">Palenzuela et al. (2009)</a>.  Implementing the IMEX scheme would be the next step allowing to simulate high Lundquist-numbers and resolve the tearing instability.

<H2><A NAME="DIVB">Divergence B source treatments</A></h2>

Both the classical and the special relativistic MHD module can deal with solneoidal magnetic field corrections through source term treatments. Traditionally, these can be written as
<p>
<IMG SRC="figmovdir/eq.divb.gif" HEIGHT=120>
<p>
Terms proportional to <b>div B</b> are 
<A HREF="methods.html#Powell's">Powell's fix</A> for the numerical
problems related to the divergence of the magnetic field. They are used only
in more than 1D. For relativistic MHD (and/or for classical), we just take the term along in the induction equation, known as Janhunen's approach. Another option is to use the diffusive (parabolic) approach, with the parameter <em>C_d</em> of order unity (up to 2).
Alternatively, there are several versions of <A HREF="methods.html#Dedner's">Dedner's</A> generalised Lagrange multiplier (GLM).

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="Positive">Positivity fixes</A></H2>
Another, similarly corrective, action is referred to as positivity fixing. This is merely an additional means to handle the supposedly rare instances where due to all nonlinearities of the scheme employed, the local conservative to primitive transformation signals a non-physical state. Our positivity fix approach can then be activated, and one such strategy operates as follows: identify all cells (within the same grid block) that represent physical states surrounding a faulty cell in a rectangular zone up to <em>nflatgetaux</em> cells away; (2) convert those cells to primitive variables; and (3) for all but the magnetic field components, replace the faulty cell values by the average of surrounding physical state cells. Finally, revert to conservative variables where needed. Obviously, in this form, strict conservation may be violated. These fix strategies are seperated off in the <em>EQUATION/correctaux.t</em> modules. They are by default inactive, and can be controlled by the parameters <b>strictgetaux</b>, <b>strictsmall</b> and other related parameters described in <A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">par/PROBLEM</A>.
<hr>
<H2><A NAME="New">Creating</A> a New VACPHYS Module</H2>

A new physics module should be created when the equations to be solved differ
significantly from the equations already implemented. If the difference can be
described by source terms (e.g. heat conduction, viscosity, radiative cooling,
external gravitational field etc.), the 
<A HREF="amrvacusr.html#Specialsource">specialsource</A> subroutine of
the AMRVACUSR module should be used instead of writing a new AMRVACPHYS module.
<p>
A new AMRVACPHYS module may be created gradually. The first step is to create 
a new folder <b>src/NEWEQ</b> with the files <b>amrvacphys.t</b> and <b>amrvacpar.t</b>.
You best copy and edit an existing AMRVACPHYS module similar to the new one. The idea is that some functionality (like any solver which requires more info than a maximal physical propagation speed, i.e. anything beyond TVDLF) should only be added at a later stage. In principle, the needed subroutines are at the minimum
<pre>
subroutine conserve          (define the primitive to conservative transformation)
subroutine primitive         (define the conservative to primitive transformation)
subroutine getv              (define the advection speed, to be seen in combination with getflux)
subroutine getcmax           (return the (minimal and) maximal physical propagation speed)
subroutine getflux           (define the physical fluxes for all variables)
subroutine getfluxforhllc    (idem as above, with slightly different call interface)
subroutine addgeometry       (in case other than cartesian cases are needed: geometrical source additions)
</pre>
<p>
If your equations contain more restrictions on the time step 
than the CFL condition, the <b>getdt</b> subroutine could be written (it is otherwise included from the <em>amrvacnul/getdt.t</em>. 
For axial symmetry <b>addgeometry</b> should provide the <em>geometrical</em> 
source terms, while other source terms may be given in <b>addsource</b>, with interface.
<p>
At this point you can use the TVDLF scheme, without any constraint. To make the
other TVD type schemes work the subroutines in the <b>amrvacnul/roe.t</b> file
should be specified, and this is not a trivial task. It is probably best to
study the existing Riemann solvers to get an idea what is required.
<p>
If you think that your new AMRVACPHYS module is of general interest, please send 
it to the developers, so we may actually make it part of the future release.
