<h1>COLLAPSED OUTPUT</h1>

Often one wishes to look at quantities integrated over one particular
direction (collapsing), yielding e.g. column densities.  For this purpose 
AMRVAC can output line integrals of the simulation variables (plus
user-specified variables) during runtime.  
<br>
The current implementation is efficient as we take advantage of the grid
structure; however only collapsing along cooridnate directions is
currently possible (which is often sufficient). 
The user can freely specify
the resolution (collapseLevel) of the resulting output data. 
No re-gridding of the domain is required, higher levels on the output grid are filled with flat interpolation.  
<br>
Note that collapsing of 1D output is not fully implemented.  
Collapsed output is sensitive to the switch <em>saveprim</em> of
the <em>filelist</em> section, therefore primitive variable output at
runtime is possible.  Also the switch <em>nwauxio</em> affects the
collapsed view to output user-defined variables.

Collapsed views are the fourth file format with output intervals that
can be specified in the <em>savelist</em> section of the par file.  To
give an example, here we ask for collapsed arrays in all three
coordinate directions, where the logical <em>collapse(1)=T</em>
specifies to output arrays integrated over the first coordinate
direction.  The other directions are analoguous.  
<pre>
 &savelist
        itsave(1,4)      = 0
        dtsave(4)        = 0.1d0
        collapse(1)      = T
        collapse(2)      = T
        collapse(3)      = T
        collapseLevel    = 3
/
</pre>
In the standard configuration, AMRVAC will output <em>*.vti</em> files
that can be visualized with paraview.  
The output filename is composed of the direction and level. For
example, the first collapsed output name reads <em>filenameout_d1_l3_nXXXX.vti</em> and analoge for the other two.  <br>
Note that the order of the (reduced) dimensions in the resulting
output files is preserved, e.g. the first collapsed array in the example above will hold the y-direction as first coordinate and the z-direction as second coordinate.  This should be kept in mind for visualization.  

<H2><A NAME="collapsedat">Collapsing of existing output</a></H2>

To collapse existing <em>*.dat</em> files, the simulation can be
restarted from a given output time and the code can be brought to a
halt after zero iterations.  This is entirely analoguous to the method
for <a href="slices.html">slicing</a> <em>*.dat</em> files and done in the following way:  its best to create a new <em>*.par</em> file (e.g. collapse.par) and clear the savelist from any output to filetypes other than <em>4</em>.  We use itsave to demand a collapse output for the zero-iteration.  
<pre>
 &savelist
        itsave(1,4)      = 0
        collapse(1)      = T
        collapse(2)      = T
        collapse(3)      = T
        collapseLevel    = 3
/
</pre>
The stoplist should look as follows:
<pre>
 &stoplist
        itreset          = .true.
        itmax            = 0
/
</pre>
where we reset the iteration counter (so that <em>itsave(1,4)=0</em> will output collapsed data) and stop the code immediately after the IO (<em>itmax=0</em>).  
<p>
The code can then be started with
<pre>
amrvac -restart 10 -i collapse.par -collapse 10 -if datamr/data
</pre>
which will take the output <em>datamr/data0010.dat</em> (-restart 10,
-if datamr/data) to create new collapsed view with index 10 (-collapse 10).  The par-file is the newly created collapse.par (-i collapse.par) so that the default used to run the code can be left untouched.  It is a simple exercise in shell scripting to run along all output-files in one go.  For example with the BASH:
<pre>
for i in {0..10}; do ./amrvac -restart $i -i collapse.par -collapse $i -if datamr/data; done
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="ascii">ASCII</a> output</H2>

As an alternative to the cell-type <em>*.vti</em> file format, you can
obtain comma-separated-value <em>*.csv</em> files of the
cell-center variables. This can be useful especially for 2D
simulations (ergo 1D line output) which can then be simply visualized
using e.g. gnuplot.  For a quick look, the <em>*.csv</em> files can be
visualized with GNUplot using a command similar to the following:
<pre>
gnuplot> p 'data_d1_l3_n0000.csv' u 2:1:9 with image
</pre>
<br>
To activate csv ASCII output, the option 
<pre>
 & filelist
        collapse_type    = 'csv'
/
</pre>
needs to be set.
