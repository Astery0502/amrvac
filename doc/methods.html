This document briefly describes the features of the spatial
discretizations available in MPI-AMRVAC. The different options can be set in the 
<A HREF="par.html#Methodlist">&amp;methodlist</A> of the <b>par/PROBLEM</b> 
file. For a more extensive description, you can read the article  
<A HREF=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gtoth/Papers/vac.html>Comparison of some FCT 
and TVD Schemes</A>. Also, the paper using MPI-AMRVAC has info on the various methods, see <em>`Parallel, grid-adaptive approaches for relativistic hydro and magnetohydrodynamics',

<p>
The acronyms TVD, TVDLF, and TVD-MUSCL stand for Total Variation Diminishing, TVD Lax-Friedrich, and 
TVD Monotonic Upwind Scheme for Conservation Laws, respectively. Then, depending on the physics module selected, you also have HLL and HLLC schemes, which are due to harten Lax, van Leer, with the HLLC variant including a treatment for the Contact discontinuity, as e.g. described for Euler gas dynamics in <em>E.F. Toro,
  Riemann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics (Berlin, Springer-Verlag, 1997)</em>.
<hr>
Not all methods are available or meaningfull for all physics modules. In fact, we have the following combinations typically:
<pre>
______________________________________________________________________________________________
PHYSICS module		Schemes
______________________________________________________________________________________________
rho			TVDLF(=HLL,HLLC),  TVD (trivial Roe), TVDMU (trivial Roe), FD
nonlinear		TVDLF(=HLL,HLLC),  FD
hdadiab			TVDLF, HLL(=HLLC), TVD (Roe solver),  TVDMU (Roe solver), FD
hd			TVDLF, HLL, HLLC,  TVD (Roe solver),  TVDMU (Roe solver), FD
mhd(iso)		TVDLF, HLL, HLLC,  TVD (Roe solver),  TVDMU (Roe solver), FD
srhd(eos)		TVDLF, HLL, HLLC,  FD
srmhd(eos)		TVDLF, HLL, HLLC,  FD
______________________________________________________________________________________________
</pre>
Also, the method can be selected per AMR grid level, but one can not combine different stepsize methods (hence, TVD is the only second order onestep method, while all others can be used with twostep or fourstep typeadvance setting). In MPI-AMRVAC, the <b>typefull1</b> is thus an array of strings, one string per level up to <b>nlevelshi</b>.
Some more info follows on the various methods.

<H2><A NAME="Centdiff">2nd Order Central Difference</A> Scheme: 
typefull1='cd',...</H2>

<p>
The explicit central differencing schemes are not stable by themselves for 
advection dominated problems. The second order central difference scheme
('cd') is used by the TVD scheme before the limiting is applied. 
Otherwise it is useful for testing a few time steps,
since this scheme contains no artificial fluxes, thus comparison with
analytic formulae is straightforward. 
It is straightforward to generalize this central difference approach to higher order accuracy, at the expense of introducing a wider stencil.

<h2><a name="fd">High order finite difference</a> Scheme: typefull1='fd',...</h2>

This implements conservative finite differences with global Lax-Friedrich flux splitting.  It can be used with almost all limiters (exluding ppm) and yields high order accuracy in space.  
For second, third and fifth order reconstruction you can set e.g.: <b>typelimiter='koren'/'cada3'/'mp5'</b>. 

<H2><A NAME="TVDLF">TVDLF</A> Scheme: typefull1='tvdlf','tvdlf1'...</H2>

<p>
The TVD Lax-Friedrich method is robust, in most cases there are no spurious
oscillations, but it is somewhat more diffusive than other TVD or HLLC
methods. Since it does not use a Riemann solver, it is usually faster than TVD or TVD-MUSCL.
<p>
The Courant number should be less than 1, <b>courantpar=0.8</b> is recommended.
Second order time discretization is best achieved by a Hancock predictor step, so the corresponding <b>typepred1='hancock'</b>.
<p>
TVDLF can be used with <b>dimsplit=F</b>, it is also preferred for steady
state calculations.
<p>
The second order TVDLF scheme <b>typefull1='tvdlf'</b> uses limiters.
There are many choices available: the 'minmod' limiter gives the smoothest 
result, the 'woodward' limiter is sharper, and the 'superbee' limiter is 
probably too sharp. The <b>'woodward'</b> limiter is recommended, but note
that the default is the most robust <b>typelimiter='minmod',...</b>.
The various options can be found in the <em>tvdlf.t</em> module, in the subroutine <em>dwlimiter2</em>.
The slope limiting is performed on the primitive variables by default.
You can limit the slopes of the conservative variables setting <b>useprimitive=F</b>
in the method list of the parameter file. You can even employ limiting on logarithmically stretched variables (which should be positive, like a density or pressure), by setting the <em>loglimit</em> flags. You can also use third order accurate <b>typelimiter='ppm'</b>, but then you need to run the code with a wider ghost cell region, namely <b>dixB=4</b>, and corresponding grid size settings. 
A third order limiter without a need to widen the ghost cell layers is the <em>'cada3'</em> limiter (sometimes called LIMO3).  
<p>
The first order TVDLF method <b>typefull='tvdlf1'</b> uses no limiters 
or predictor step as it is only first order accurate. 

<H2><A NAME="TVDMUSCL">TVD</A>-MUSCL Scheme: typefull1='tvdmu','tvdmu1',...</H2>

<p>
The TVD-MUSCL scheme is a two-step TVD algorithm using the same Hancock
predictor step and upwinding as TVDLF, and a characteristic based Riemann
solver similar to the TVD method. 
At the moment Riemann solvers are implemented for adiabatic hydrodynamics 
(setvac -p=hdadiab), hydrodynamics (-p=hd), and full MHD (-p=mhd). 
The scalar transport equation (-p=rho) has a trivial Riemann solver. 
The scheme has comparable resolution to the non-MUSCL
TVD method.
<p>
The first order <b>typefull='tvdmu1'</b> scheme uses no limiters, it is 
a first order upwind scheme <em>for each characteristic variable</em>. 
It may be used for test purposes.
<p>
The Courant number should be less than 1, <b>courantpar=0.8</b> is recommended.
<p>
TVD-MUSCL can be dimensionally split <b>dimsplit=T</b> or unsplit <b>F</b>.
The multistep Runge-Kutta schemes can be applied, such as "typeadvance='fourstep'".
<p>
<b>typelimiter</b> has the same meaning as for TVDLF.
The slope limiting is performed on the conservative variables by default.
Numerical problems (e.g. negative temperature) can often be avoided by
limiting the slopes of the primitive variables setting <b>useprimitive=T</b>
in the method list of the parameter file.
<p>
Linear Riemann solvers can produce non-physical solutions. This can be
eliminated by the use of an entropy fix, controlled by <b>typeentropy</b> and the <b>entropycoef</b>. The default is <b>typeentropy='nul',...</b>. See the details for the entropy fixes in the respective <em>amrvacphys.PHYSroe.t</em> files, as well as in the <em>tvd.t</em> module.

<H2><A NAME="TVD">TVD</A> Scheme: typefull1='tvd','tvd1',...</H2>

<p>
The non-MUSCL TVD method with Roe's approximate Riemann solver is one of
the most accurate and efficient of the implemented schemes. 
<p>
There are a few variants of the TVD scheme, but the default 
is <b>typetvd='roe'</b>. Details are in the <em>tvd.t
</em> module.
<p>
This solver has to be dimensionally split, set <b>dimsplit=T</b>.
<p>
The Courant number should be less than 1, <b>courantpar=0.8</b> is recommended.
<p>
The same limiters can be used as for TVDLF and TVD MUSCL, but they are 
applied to the characteristic waves, rather than to the conservative 
variables. The order of the characteristic waves is defined in the 
<b>amrvacpar.t.*</b> files. The <b>'woodward'</b> limiter is recommended, 
but note that the default is <b>typelimiter='minmod',...</b>. 
<p>
The TVD scheme is a single step method.
For steady state calculations, however, the 
<em>temporally first but spatially second order</em> <b>tvd1</b>
method is advised. 
This scheme was suggested by H.Yee: simply all terms
proportional to dt**2 are omitted from the TVD scheme.
<p>
The entropy fix for the Riemann solver is given by the <b>typeentropy</b>
array, it has the same meaning as for the TVD-MUSCL method, and for MHD,
the divergence B problem should also be taken care of.

<H2><A NAME="HLL">HLL and HLLC</A> schemes</H2>

The TVDLF scheme hence uses minimal info on the wave speeds, and in combination with AMR and its inherent robustness due to its diffusive nature, it is readily usable for any system of conservation laws at minimal implementation costs.
Maximal wave speed info is used in a full Roe-type approximate Riemann solver as employed by TVD or TVD-MUSCL, where all characteristic wave speeds (7 in total for (relativistic) MHD) as well as the wave strengths are deduced from the eigenvalues, as well as right and left eigenvector pairs of the flux Jacobian. The simpler HLL, HLLC solvers, make further approximations to their corresponding representation of the Riemann fan, as schematically illustrated below.
<center><IMG SRC="figmovdir/solvers.gif"></center>
These type of solvers originated in gas dynamics and Newtonian MHD, and have meanwhile been adapted to relativistic (M)HD.
Depending on the amount of waves used to approximate the actual 7-wave fan, a corresponding amount of different fluxes are computed. One switches between their expressions according to the relative orientation of the wave signals in the (x,t) diagram.
Appropriate recipes for computing meaningful intermediate states ensure desirable properties like positivity (positive pressures and densities), the ability to capture isolated discontinuities, etc. For most physics modules, these HLL and HLC variants are available too. The HLLD variant is only applicable for MHD, and is not implemented in the repository version.


<H2><A NAME="Divb">Maintaining</A> the div B=0 Condition</H2>

In multidimensional MHD the numerical conservation of div B is
not guaranteed by the standard TVD or HLL type schemes. 
This can lead to inaccuracies as well as instablilities.
For all the schemes below, you can influence how to compute div B, by setting <em>typegrad</em> and <em>typediv</em>, along with <em>typegradlimiter1</em>. This allows to select either a standard central difference evaluation, or one evaluated after the cell-center values have been reconstructed to the cell edges.

<H4><A NAME="Powell's">Powell</A>'s fix: typedivbfix='powel'</H4>

For multidimensional MHD calculations the non-conservative form of
the <A HREF=equations.html#MHD>MHD equations</A> seems to produce better 
results than the usual conservative form. The idea is to include
source terms proportional to div B into the momentum, energy and induction
equations and to add a divergence wave for the Riemann solver.
<p>
Powell's scheme is fast, it stabilizes the Riemann solver, and improves results
for TVDLF and similar type methods, but it is non-conservative, and div B is not kept close to zero. </br>
<em>Note the typo: 'powel' is the option and not 'powell' as would be
  the correct spelling...</em>

<H4><A NAME="Janhunen">Janhunen</A>'s fix: typedivbfix='janhunen'</H4>

Only the source term added to the induction equation is added. This approach is usable for both classical and relativistic MHD.

<H4><A NAME="Diffusive">Diffusive</A> fix: typedivbfix='linde'</H4>

You can also use the diffusive (parabolic) approach, see the <A HREF="equations.html#DIVB">equations</A>. It uses a C_d coefficient quantified by <em>divbdiff</em>, which can be up to 2. This method is by default inactive, identified by <em>divbdiff=-1</em>, but it is recommended for many multi-D MHD applications.

<H4><A NAME="Dedner's">Dedner</A>'s fix: typedivbfix='glm1/glm2/glm3'</H4>

This implements the mixed hyperbolic and parabolic dampening of the divB error using an additional scalar variable <em>Psi</em> (need an addition of the name and boundary condition type in your par-file). The algorithm is described by Dedner et al. in  <em>Journal of Computational Physics 175, 645-673 (2002) doi:10.1006/jcph.2001.6961</em>.
To setup AMRVAC for this method, add to <em>definitions.h</em> the line
<pre>#define GLM</pre>
and choose <em>typedivbfix='glm1/glm2/glm3'</em> in your methodlist. 
The three versions differ in the source terms taken along.  
Thus in non-relativistic <em>mhd</em>, 'glm1' corresponds to <em>Equation (24)</em> of Dedner et al and 'glm2' corresponds to <em>Equation (38)</em> of this paper.  The option 'glm3' adds no additional sources to the MHD system.  In <em>srmhd</em>, we recommend the option 'glm1' which is the one without source terms in this case. 
For example:<br>
in your par-file,
<pre>
primnames='rho v1 v2 v3 p b1 b2 b3 psi'

wnames='rho m1 m2 m3 e b1 b2 b3 psi'

typedivbfix='glm3'

typeB= 8*'special','cont',8*'speical','cont', ...
</pre>
in your  <em>definitions.h</em>,
<pre>
#define GLM
</pre>
in your <em>amrvacusr.t</em>, add
<pre>
{#IFDEF GLM
w(ixG^S,psi_)=0.d0
}
</pre>
in subroutine initonegrid_usr. 

<H4><A NAME="fct">Flux</A>-CT</H4>

The Flux-CT method, described in <em>Secction 4.4</em> of Gabor Toth's
paper 
<em>Journal of Computational Physics 161, 605-652 (2000) doi:10.1006/jcph.2000.6519</em>
is tested for 2D and 3D Cartesian grids without AMR.  It conserves the
the divB <em>on the corners</em> to machine precision.  To set it up, add to <em>definitions.h</em> the line 
<pre>#define FCT</pre>
and allow for one additional ghost layer (in <code>
  $AMRVAC_DIR/setup.pl -g=...
  </code>
and <code>
  dixB=...
  </code>
in your par-file).  The subroutine <code>
  getdivb() 
  </code>
returns the divB conserved by the scheme.  To setup magnetic fields,
you should provide the <b>vectorpotential</b> in the subroutine<code>
  initvecpot_usr()
  </code>
and you can call <code>
  b_from_vectorpotential()
  </code>
  in your <code>
  initgrid_usr()
  </code>
to initialize the solution vector with the consistent fields.  <br>
Note that non-trivial boundary conditions can introduce divB to this
scheme, so be wary when you are using anything other than <em>symm,
  asmm</em> or <em>periodic</em>!
