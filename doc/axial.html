<h1>USING AXIAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SYMMETRY</h1>

This document describes how to use properly axial symmetry and polar grids.
It is relevant when doing simulations with <b>typeaxial</b> different from 'slab' in the <b>methodlist</b> of 
your <b>par/PROBLEM</b> parameter file.

<H2><A NAME="What">What</A> does Axial Symmetry Mean?</H2>

In 1 and 2D simulations, there is an inherent assumption about the behavior
of quantities in the ignored direction(s). The most usual assumption is
'slab' symmetry, i.e. all the quantities are invariant to a translation in the 
ignored direction. 
<p>
In 2D, one may assume a rotational invariance around some axis instead, which
gives a cylindrical symmetry, thus <b>typeaxial='cylindrical'</b> should be 
selected. MPI-AMRVAC always assumes that the radial distance from the symmetry axis 
is in the first coordinate, which can therefore be referred to as <b>r_</b>, 
where <b>r_=1</b> is an integer parameter set in <b>src/amrvacdef.t</b>. 
When setting
<pre>
setamrvac -d=23 -z=2 -phi=3
</pre>
the second coordinate is interpreted as the one parallel to the axis, 
<b>z_=2</b>, while the ignored direction is <b>phi_=3</b> in 2.5D.
The PHI components of vector variables are then
stored in the third component in 2.5D simulations.
<p>
Actually, for 2D and 'cylindrical' (which can be 2D or 2.5D) the grid and the symmetry depend on the settings for the -phi and -z flags. When -d=22 -z=2, a cartesian grid is used in a poloidal plane, with axial symmetry for the r- and z- vector components. The same is true for -d=23 -z=2 -phi=3, when all three vector components are then depending on (r,z) coordinates only. The vector components then appear in the r,z,phi order.
One can use 2.5D on a circular grid also with translational symmetry in the third, i.e. axial, direction by the use of <em>setamrvac -d=23 -phi=2 -z=3</em>. The vector components then appear in the r,phi,z order.
<p>
In spherical symmetry, <b>typeaxial='spherical'</b>, the invariant transformation 
is a rotation around the origin. Again, the first coordinate is <b>r_=1</b>. 
For 2D and 'spherical', the coordinates denote radial and polar angle in a poloidal plane, and similarly for 2.5D in combination with spherical where the third vector component is then the phi-component, depending on (r,theta) alone. This means that 2D and 'spherical' implies the use of a polar grid in a poloidal cross-section (i.e. one containing the symmetry axis) and axial symmetry for 2.5D runs. Note that the <em>-phi -z</em> flags for <em>setamrvac</em> have no influence when selecting <b>typeaxial='spherical'</b>.

<H2><A NAME="Polargrid">What</A> does Polar Grid Mean?</H2>

In case of a polar grid (<b>typeaxial='cylindrical'</b>) the PHI direction is not ignored.
<p>
In 2D, the data in the <b>x</b> coordinates is interpreted as radial distance
<b>r</b> and the angular coordinate <b>phi</b> is measured in radians.
The <b>dx</b> array contains <b>dr</b> and <b>r*dphi</b> and MPI-AMRVAC treats
everything the same way as in a Cartesian grid. Meaningfull 2D settings are
<pre>
setamrvac -d=22 -phi=2 -z=0
setamrvac -d=23 -phi=2 -z=3
</pre>
The main difference is that the geometric source terms are added
due to <b>typeaxial='cylindrical'</b>. The former setting is purely 2D, the latter setting is 2.5D, and assumes translational invariance with the z direction.
<p>
In 3D, there are two possibilities: the coordinates can be ordered as 
<b>r, z, phi</b> or <b>r, phi, z</b>, where <b>z</b> is the vertical position.
<pre>
setamrvac -d=33 -phi=2 -z=3
setamrvac -d=33 -phi=3 -z=2
</pre>
<p>
The vector variables also have their components in the <b>r, phi</b>, and 
<b>z</b> directions. These facts should be kept in mind when the initial 
conditions are defined, when source terms are applied, or when the results are 
visualized.
<p>

In slab symmetry all fluxes entering the cells from the ignored direction 
cancel exactly. In cylindrical or spherical symmetry, however, there are
non-vanishing contributions. These extra fluxes are always functions of 
the quantities in the local cell and of the geometry only, since due to 
the symmetry assumption, the quantities in the virtual neighbouring cells 
in the ignored direction(s) are the same as in the local cell except for the 
geometrical transformation, e.g. rotation of vector quantities around 
the symmetry axis. Consequently the contributions are added like source 
terms in the <b>addgeometry</b> subroutine in <b>src/amrvacphys</b>. 
To maintain equilibrium better, the 'geometrical sources' 
are added at the same time as fluxes in the radial direction.
<p>
On a polar grid the extra terms are exactly the same as for cylindrical 
symmetry.

<H2><A NAME="Boundary">Boundary</A> at the Symmetry Axis</H2>

The symmetry axis is actually a special case of periodicity.
For 3D cylindrical and spherical grid computations, the singular polar axis is trivially handled using a so-called pi-periodic boundary treatment, where periodicity across the pole comes from the grid cell diagonally across the pole, i.e. displaced over pi instead of 2 pi. These are automatically recognized from the typeaxial setting, if the radial range starts at zero. The corresponding range in angle phi must span 2 pi for cylindrical, and theta must then start at zero (to include the north pole) and/or end at pi (for the south pole) for spherical grids. The user just needs to set the typeB as if the singular axis is a symmetry boundary (using symm and asymm combinations). <b>There is one important restriction: the number of grid blocks must be even around the pole.</b>
