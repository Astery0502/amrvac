<P>
This version of the MPI-AMRVAC software was initiated in the course of 2006-2007 by <B>Bart van der Holst</B> (meanwhile at University of Michigan) in a close collaboration with <A HREF="http://perswww.kuleuven.be/~u0016541">Rony Keppens </A> at the 
<A HREF="http://wis.kuleuven.be/cpa">Centre
for Plasma-Astrophysics (CPA)</A> at K.U.Leuven. The code has witnessed continuous improvements and additions, with <B>Zakaria Meliani</B> as the main core developer since 2005-2006 (for the relativistic physics modules, parallel conversion of MPI-AMRVAC I/O to a large variety of postprocessing formats for later visualization, and for many overall code additions/improvements), and <B>Oliver Porth</B> joining in on the core team since 2010. Other contributors to the project are
<I> Allard Jan van Marle </I> (for optically thin radiative loss treatments), <I> Peter Delmont </I>(some of the visualization capabilities), <I> Chun Xia </I>([an]isotropic thermal conduction) and the growing number of users at CPA and abroad.

MPI-AMRVAC is an MPI-parallelized Adaptive Mesh Refinement code, with some heritage (in the solver part) to the <A HREF="http://grid.engin.umich.edu/~gtoth/VAC">Versatile Advection Code </A>  or VAC, initiated by G&aacute;bor T&oacute;th at the 
Astronomical Institute at Utrecht in November 1994, with help from Rony Keppens since 1996. Previous incarnations of the Adaptive Mesh Refinement version of VAC were of restricted use only, and have been used for basic research in AMR strategies, or for well-targeted applications.
This MPI version uses a full octree block-based approach, and allows for general orthogonal coordinate systems. 
Tests have been performed on various supercomputing facilities throughout Europe.

<H3><A NAME="Codes">Code aims and requirements</A></h3>

MPI-AMRVAC aims to advance any system of (primarily hyperbolic) partial differential equations by a number of
different numerical schemes. The emphasis is on (near) conservation laws, with shock-dominated problems as a main research target. The actual equations are stored in separate 
modules, can be added if needed, and they can be selected by a simple configuration of the
VACPP preprocessor. The dimensionality of the problem is also set 
through VACPP. The numerical schemes are able to handle discontinuities
and smooth flows as well.
<P>
For running and installing the code, you need MPI (Message Passing Interface, 
<A HREF="http://www.mpi-forum.org/index.html">MPI-2</A>) combined with a Fortran 90 (or 95) compiler, and Perl for the pre-processing, which is standard on any Unix-based platform. To make sure you have access to the latest version of the code, you will need <A HREF="http://subversion.apache.org/">subversion</A>, a free, open-source version control system. No other libraries are required. The code is in use on Mac laptops, Unix desktops, to modern supercomputing facilities.
<p>
Visualization or analysis of the results can be done <b>a posteriori</B>, by converting data files produced
during runtime. Each data file contains a single snapshot of the entire data structure (all unknowns and the full grid tree), and are essential for e.g. restarts, and 
<IT>need to be saved in the internal <B>*.dat</B> format.</IT> 
Each snapshot can be converted <b>with the same executable used to run the simulation (but possibly on a different platform)</B> to IDL, openDX, Tecplot, or VTK native formats, which must then
be visualized with the corresponding software. We (june 2010) mostly use the freely available <A HREF="http://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</A> application for data visualization.
<p>
The 
<A HREF="vacpp.html">VACPP</A>
preprocessor translates the dimensional independent notation 
(based on the Loop Annotation Syntax, 
 or LASY)
to Fortran 90. It uses Perl, and the Perl interpreter is installed on any UNIX-like platform at most places,
and it is freely available from the net.
<p>

<H3><A NAME="Philosophy">Philosophy</A></h3>

The philosophy behind MPI-AMRVAC is using a single versatile software 
with options and switches for various problems, rather than developing
a different method or version for each problem separately. The advantage
of such a general approach is a reduction of overall time for software 
development, easier maintenance, compatibility of different parts, 
automatic extension of new features to all existing applications. 
The price of the general approach is some added complexity in the source.
<p>
MPI-AMRVAC is not a fool-proof black-box design. The user is expected to 
understand how the different parameters change the behaviour of the
code, and to be able to complete user written subroutines for source
terms, special boundary conditions etc. if needed. It is essential to
keep the user written parts well separated.
Please put added subroutines into a separate AMRVACUSR module
in the <b>src/usr</b> subdirectory under the <b>src</B> (source) directory. 
You must then think of a suitable name, of the form <b>src/usr/amrvacusr.t.MINE</b>.
